        <h1>Cleaner Finches and Bloodpeckers</h1>
        <h2>Cleaner Finches</h2>
        <figure><img alt="cleaner finches" src="images/cleanerfinches_by_sheather888-dav028n.png" />
            <figcaption> <strong>above:</strong> a pair of crested double-barred cleaner finches groom a juvenile
                serestrider. </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Though large enough that few other birds can prey upon them, there <em>are</em> hungry predators that gain
            their sustenance from the great serestriders: parasites. Biting vespers take a toll in the hot summers while
            blood-sucking mites can feed throughout the year, kept warm under their plumage. <strong>Covered from head
                to toe in fuzzy hair-like feathers and with necks so long as to be impossible for an individual to groom
                on its own</strong>, the gentle giants are a walking buffet to dozens of invertebrate pests, seemingly
            offered up for the taking.</p>
        <p>But this is not entirely true, thanks to another of Serina's endemic symbiosis. A variety of Serina's giant
            birds - but especially serestriders - <strong>rely on mutualistic relationships with far smaller
                insect-eating finches to keep their plumage clean of dead tissue and insect parasites</strong>. Birds
            such as the serestriders are large enough that they themselves support their own small portable ecosystem,
            of which their own blood forms the basis and sparrow-sized insectivores fill the niche of apex predator. The
            serestrider is so large that is seems to not even notice the flocks of small birds climbing all over their
            bodies and picking through their feathers, even when the finches alight on their snouts and pick at their
            eyelashes and into their nostrils. <strong>If an unfamiliar bird tries the same thing however, the giant
                reveals that it clearly does pay attention, for it will quickly shake the intruder away</strong>,
            avoiding other finches that might potentially do it harm; indeed, <strong>another group of canaries aptly
                known as bloodpeckers also frequently try to glean a meal from the large aardgeese in a much more
                harmful way.</strong> Thus, via convergent evolution, most cleaner finches that service the serestriders
            have evolved similar markings and color schemes to show that they mean no harm. These patterns are often
            remarkably similar even across totally unrelated clades - a bright yellow head and a blue body, with obvious
            black stripes running along the eye and down the neck. <strong>No one can say for sure why this pattern
                seems to have become the universal signal for a pest-removal service, but whichever bird first adopted
                it has been mimicked at least six times in unrelated groups of birds across the western
                hemisphere</strong>, all cashing in on the same bounty of food.</p>
        <p>The system is usually mutually beneficial - the serestrider is kept clean of pests and the finches fill their
            bellies - <strong>but not all finches are friends to the giant</strong>. Some species mimic the coloration
            of beneficial species but are actually parasites themselves, enlarging wounds to lick the blood and even
            taking small pieces of living tissue rather than eating insects. Some of these pest birds evolved directly
            from formerly beneficial cleaner finches which went to the dark side; others seem to have evolved
            independently from other lineages, including the bloodpeckers themselves, one species of which seems to be
            evolving to take on the same pattern but to be not completely there yet; without quite the correct shades
            and proportions of color, sometimes it is tolerated and sometimes shaken off aggressively by the
            serestriders. With those birds that look most like the harmless cleaners being able to get a blood meal more
            frequently, the <strong>serestrider is inadvertently cultivating a pest that will over time become harder
                and harder to distinguish and weed out from its kinder fellows</strong> in a rare natural example of <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vavilovian_mimicry" rel="nofollow">vavilovian mimicry</a> - or its
            animal equivalent.</p>
        <p class="asterism">&#8258;</p>
        <p><strong>The true cleaner finches also perform another service to the serestrider in eating aggressive bamboo
                ants that might be disturbed while the giant feeds on their host trees.</strong> While some species
            specialize in plucking ticks from the serestrider's feathers or catching flies as they try to land and get a
            drink of blood, <strong>perhaps the most specialized of all are ant-eaters</strong> that spend almost all of
            their time crawling along their host's snout, where the armored beak meets the plumage. Here they snatch up
            any and all ants that rush to the defense of their host tree, <strong>killing them before they get a chance
                to bite or sting the sensitive skin on the serestrider's face. </strong> The serestrider is thus able to
            browse freely, and the anteater canaries allowed access to a limitless supply of food for almost no effort -
            their host literally brings the food to them as they perch upon its nose.</p>
        <h2>Bloodpeckers </h2>
        <p><strong>Bloodpeckers</strong> are a family of carnivorous finches native to the western hemisphere,<strong>
                most of which are parasites to larger animals</strong>. The group has its evolutionary origins far back
            in Serina's history, diverging from all of the world's birds more than sixty million years ago, and have
            been targeting the blood, skin, and other small bits of flesh from large flightless birds for as long as
            they've existed. Though some bloodpeckers feed opportunistically on insects, they have never specialized as
            insectivores at any point in their evolutionary history and likely made the jump to parasitism from feeding
            on other birds' eggs and nestlings. Most of a bloodpecker's anatomy is fairly generalized and similar to
            other songbirds, though their toes have become zygodactyl, with two facing backward, in order to better
            facilitate the clinging and climbing on the bodies of larger animals, often clinging upside down on bellies
            and other areas their victims cannot easily knock them off from. They are small and stocky, their wings are
            relatively short and their tails stumpy, and their heads often rather large for their size; generally they
            are weak flyers. The beak is tipped with a sharply angled hook which is used to make small cuts into other
            birds' hide. <strong>Though they do take a fair amount of liquid blood, the bloodpeckers' favored food is
                the skin and underlying fat and muscle</strong>, which they cut from the wounds they dig out in tiny
            strips; this very nourishing food source makes up the majority of what they feed their nestlings. Because a
            bloodpecker can cause significant harm when it feeds, it does a potential victim well to be wary and drive
            off the parasite before it lands, the fear of the vampires likely a driving factor in the specific color
            patterns adopted by the harmless cleaner birds to make them immediately distinguishable. </p>
        <p>To make themselves less noticeable, <strong>most bloodpeckers are therefore nocturnal and cryptically
                colored</strong>; guided by large eyes, they make their attacks under the cover of darkness when their
            prey are asleep or at the very least less able to spot them before they feed - <strong>only the false
                cleaner finch, which mimics the colorful markings of a harmless cleaner bird, feeds exclusively by
                day</strong>. The actual feeding process is usually brief, with the bird landing and immediately getting
            to work nipping a small wound, then quickly slicing off a strip of skin and flying off, but through the
            course of a night a bird will frequently return for seconds and thirds, joined as the hours pass by other
            individuals taking advantage of the injury, so that by morning, a prey animal may find itself with one or
            more quarter-sized wounds up to half an inch deep. <strong>A healthy serestrider or other large bird quickly
                heals and will not suffer any long-term effects from the bloodpecker's feed</strong> - though old
            individuals are frequently pockmarked with healed scars from bloodpecker wounds under their plumage - but
            the birds can cause significant weakness to already ailing animals too weak to fend them off, in which case
            the birds may even be bold enough to attack in daylight. <strong>Bloodpeckers are naturally drawn to open
                wounds and the sight of blood and will congregate on injuries sustained by other animals</strong>, even
            carnivores, to pick at the exposed tissue and lap up any flowing blood. Though the bloodpecker does cause
            injury to healthy animals, <strong>its actions of picking at already open wounds actually serve a beneficial
                purpose by removing dead, septic or diseased tissue, as well as insect larvae, and cleansing the wound
                of infection.</strong></p>
        <p>Relatives of the bloodpeckers are another group of carnivorous finches known as <strong>strackbirds</strong>,
            or colloquially just <strong>stracks</strong> - short for "distracts", a name that only makes sense once one
            is familiar with their behavior. Unlike true bloodpeckers, <strong>the stracks don't feed on living
                animals</strong>, but still have a taste for blood. <strong>Rather they associate closely with large
                predators</strong>, often riding directly on their backs, and <strong>assist the carnivores in killing
                prey by flying ahead of their host and harassing potential prey animals</strong>. Better flyers than
            their kin, they dive-bomb other animals and peck at their eyes and ears in an attempt to distract them from
            keeping an eye on their surroundings while their host approaches and makes an ambush. Taking advantage of
            the chaos, the predator hopefully makes a kill before the prey can react and try to flee, in which case the
            small finches will swoop in and steal their share of the riches from the carcass, being small enough that
            the carnivore scarcely pays them any mind. In between kills, the stracks feed on their host's parasites and
            the dried blood that sticks in their plumage after a feed, <strong>serving a hygienic function sufficiently
                beneficial to the hunter that for the most part it completely ignores their presence.</strong></p>
        <p>Unlike other bloodpeckers, they are usually diurnal and often brightly colored in shades of yellow, red, and
            orange.</p>
        <figure><img alt="strackbird, bloodpecker, false cleaner finch" src="images/qgj2KQf.png" />
            <figcaption><strong>above:</strong> from left to right: orange-shouldered strackbird; common bloodpecker;
                false cleaner finch.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>The <strong>orange-shouldered strackbird</strong> is a relatively large thrush-like bird common across the
            grasslands of South Anciska, where it associates closely with large carnivorous skykes, distracting
            herbivores to make them more vulnerable prey to its host and scavenging any successful kills the carnivore
            makes.</p>
        <p><strong>Common bloodpeckers</strong>, about as large as a zebra finch, are small nocturnal parasites which
            target large forest-dwelling birds, feeding in small flocks under cover of darkness. Its wings are edged in
            hair-like filaments that serve to dampen the sound of its wingbeats, allowing it to flutter almost silently
            as it comes in for a meal. </p>
        <p>The <strong>false cleaner finch</strong> is a house sparrow-sized diurnal bloodpecker evolved to mimic
            beneficial cleaner birds. It hides in flocks of similarly-marked cleaners and follows them from one
            serestrider to another. While its company busily pick away the giant's parasites, the false cleaner opens up
            wounds and picks at the host's blood and tissue for its sustenance. </em></p>
        <p class="asterism">&#8258;</p>
        <p></p>Both stracks and bloodpeckers are not always successful in their attacks, however, <strong>for some
            species of beneficial cleaner birds - in an effort to protect their food supply and therefore their hosts -
            will drive off other birds</strong>, both competitors and predators, that approach too closely to their
        chosen individual or herd. Similar to the battles that rage between Serina's bamboo trees and their symbiotic
        ant colonies, <strong>a similar evolutionary arms race has begun between different flightless birds and their
            own flying symbiotic partners.</strong>
