        <h1>Desert Flora</h1>
        <p>From left to right, a sampling of five desert plants. The three upon the left are specialized sunflower
            trees, exhibiting varying degrees of adaptation to survive arid environments. </p>
        <figure><img src="images/F2Y2m1j.png" alt="desert flora" /></figure>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Devil's Cigar</strong>. This columnar, clumping sunflower is a long-lived perennial. To
                    protect its juicy stems from evaporation and the attacks of thirsty animals, its leaves have become
                    reduced to needle-sharp scales edged in silica platelets that will give a nasty cut to anything
                    desperate enough to attempt to bite into it. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, born near the
                    leading growth at the tips of the stems and pollinated by small flying insects. It sets seed into
                    the air, attached to small parachutes of fibers that catch the wind. Stems grow indefinitely from an
                    underground rhizome with only a single growing tip, and if broken will die back rather than develop
                    secondary branching. In good conditions they may reach heights of seven feet, but typically become
                    damaged before this. New trunks which rise from the roots replace old ones which have lost their
                    growing tips. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Zucchini Tree</strong>. This sunflower is a large, tree-like species which grows a single
                    trunk. When young, it is covered in a protective coat of sharp spikes like the devil's cigar but
                    once it reaches a significant height beyond the reach of most herbivores, it stops producing this
                    armor, retaining this defense only on its lower trunk. Its flowers are large and born in groups at
                    the tips of its rounded, zucchini-shaped stems. Once a stem has produced a flower, it does not
                    continue to grow, but unlike the devil's cigar it doesn't die back but instead puts out several side
                    branches which continue to grow upwards; the zucchini tree thus multiplies its shoots by two or
                    three times with each tuft of flowers it puts out. The sunflower tree still puts out leaves as it
                    grows but they are short-lived, being shed during the dry season, at which point the plant
                    photosynthesizes with its stems alone. When blooming, the trees stems briefly take on a primitive
                    appearance with larger leaves in the weeks before flowering, giving the impression of small garden
                    sunflowers grafted to the top of an ungainly cactus. These leaves are shed along with the flowering
                    stems within a few weeks, as soon as the plants seeds have been produced. Because the zucchini tree
                    is a long lived plant rather than an annual, like its ancestor, it cannot afford to produce large
                    amounts of large, tasty seeds that may be eaten up by birds. It thus produces small, bitter seeds in
                    large, inedible pods which break open and disperse via the wind and attract little attention from
                    birds, similarly to the devils' cigar.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Desert Bottlebrush</strong>. This very cactus-like sunflower grows only a single trunk and
                    never branches. Its flowers are large and showy, pollinated by birds, and it produces large and
                    savory fruits in which it hides it seeds in order to disperse them through the guts of animals that
                    consume them. It grows only small, vestigial green leaves while blooming, its leaves otherwise
                    adapted into large and very sharp spines that protect its fat, water-filled trunk from animals.</p>
                <p>This plant is not a sunflower but rather a dandelion, a direct descendant of the scrubby sunflower
                    bushes of the Anciskan drylands of 15 million years PE. Resembling a yucca or an aloe, it is still a
                    branching shrub or small tree with extremely sharp leaves edged in microscopic serrations to guard
                    against herbivores, but now grows considerably larger. Its flowers have changed, and no longer born
                    singly, it now sends out long, pendulous bunches of brightly colored and nectar-rich flowers at the
                    points where its leaves meet its stems. Birds are its main pollinators. Its method of seed dispersal
                    remains that of its ancestors - tufted, lightweight seeds cast out to the wind.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Desert bamboo</strong>. A primitive bamboo, it lacks the symbiotic ants of its more derived
                forest-building relatives and has been driven out of its preferred wet and fertile habitat by its
                relative's insect defenders to the cold deserts of southern Striata. The dry environment has had a very
                significant effect on its growth habit and it no longer produces tall canes but rather exists as a small
                and inconspicuous clump of spiny grass for most of its long life, hardly even recognizable as a member
                of the bamboo family. It spends 150 years in this state, slowly building a large and wide-ranging root
                system through the desert and spreading by runners but never reaching more than 15 inches tall, until
                some mysterious timer within the bamboo's cells goes off. When this happens, every member of a given
                species reroutes all of the tediously collected and stored energy from its roots and tissues into
                producing a single enormous flower stalk that can reach up to thirty feet tall. Timing its reproduction
                so closely with its fellows across the desert, the resulting boom of seeds briefly overwhelms the
                appetite of all the animals which feed upon them, ensuring that some will survive to germinate no matter
                what. After a lifespan of one and a half centuries, it blooms for just weeks and dies after its seeds
                have dried, having used every last ounce of its energy to produce its offspring. The extremely sporadic
                abundances of its seeds produce a brief flurry of reproduction in all life that feeds upon them and a
                very successful nesting season for all the desert's birds, only to be followed by a massive population
                crash when the food is no longer available by the next season. It is possible that in addition to the
                protective benefits gained from producing too many seeds for the animal population to eat, the bamboo
                helps its offspring in another way: by encouraging a population spike and then a mass die-off of the
                animals which would otherwise potentially eat its young seedlings the next year when they sprout.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>A variety of Serina's less derived bird groups which inhabit desert environments have been illustrated
            alongside the flora. Examples shown include a couple of primitive seed-eaters, an insect-eating bird which
            has begun to include flower nectar in its diet, a large, turkey-like, and poor-flying omnivore, a dove-like
            terrestrial seed-eater, a long-legged falconary which hunts prey on the ground, and a small predatory finch
            which eats insects and smaller birds.</p>
