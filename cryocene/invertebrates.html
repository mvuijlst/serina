        <h1>Invertebrates of the Cryocene</h1>
        <p>Insects, arachnids, crustaceans, molluscs, and cnidarians have called Serina home since even before the
            introduction of the canaries. More than 50 million years on, a relatively small group of founders have given
            rise to many new and novel lineages.</p>
        <h2>Ants</h2>
        <p>The <strong>leafcutter ants</strong> and their descendants, the <strong><em>Phytosocianae</em></strong> ants
            ("plant partners") which live in in mutualistic partnerships with most Serinan bamboo groups are not the
            only ants of the Cryocene. The Formicidae are still among the most successful insect groups on the planet
            and occur on every landmass. The original process of evolution which gave rise to the mostly flightless,
            subterranean ant as we know it in the Cretaceous era has worked backwards on some of them, giving rise first
            to the primitive gnat-like <strong>honey ants</strong>, which were mainly nectivorous, which have now split
            into three distinct groups - the true honey ants (which are still nectar-drinking and often social, very
            much like honeybees), the more generalized <strong>hymflies</strong>, which are usually solitary and take
            diets ranging from nectar to smaller insects to carrion and even blood, and later to several other wasp-like
            lineages which keep their wings throughout life, exhibiting a wider variety of lifestyles including
            sharp-jawed, agile predators that feed on other insects. Known as <strong>vespers</strong>, they are a
            <strong>polyphyletic assemblage of at least three independently derived groups,</strong> some descended from
            honey ants and others independently derived from basal ant ancestors but all of which for the most part are
            similar enough in relation to one another than their exact ancestry is not of importance to the layman. Some
            vespers produce venomous stings like wasps, defensive and offensive abilities which have already evolved and
            been lost several times, while one solitary group known as the <strong>fangflies</strong> has evolved large,
            mobile jaws and <strong>a venomous bite to subdue its prey</strong>. Vespers may be either social or
            solitary, hunting alone or building nests in trees or underground. <strong>The largest solitary species,
                adept pursuit predators in the air with two pairs of independently mobile, dragonfly-like wings, reach
                five inches in length and may occasionally take small birds as prey</strong>, while smaller but highly
            aggressive swarming species are capable of killing much larger animals to defend their colonies. </p>
        <p>In the inverse, <strong>small blind ants which spend almost their entire leaves deep below ground have
                evolved</strong>, converging on termites. Some forms even built towering mud structures for their
            colonies on Serina's plains, and at the shores of the equatorial oceans, <strong>specialized mangrove ants
                survive in a world that is submerged in seawater almost 50% of the time.</strong></p>
        <h2>Crickets</h2>
        <p>The <strong>burrowing crickets </strong>of the Hypostecene and early Tempuscenic have continued to diversify
            and spread across Serina, becoming both herbivores - like voles - and carnivores - like moles. Herbivorous
            species tunnel just beneath the surface of the soil, chewing at plant roots and tubers, while carnivores
            burrow down deeper in search of worms and other meaty prey that they dismember with large, sharp mandibles.
            Though most species are small, in the range of one to two inches, relative giants still exist.
            <strong>Burrowing crickets often live longer lives than their ancestors and survive multiple
                season</strong>s, surviving winters by burrowing deep underground below the frost line and hibernating.
            Some species from temperate seasonal environments, having very slowed metabolic rates and needs for food,
            <strong>may live twenty-five years and attain a weight of four pounds.</strong> Herbivores feeding on the
            sap of tree roots, they avoid most predators by merit of almost never coming above ground. Their anatomy has
            changed markedly to facilitate this lifestyle, their hind legs becoming small and their front legs adapting
            into enormous claws to move soil. <strong>They are blind and basically deaf</strong>, relying entirely on
            their sense of smell and touch with long sensitive hairs on their bodies and lengthy antennae. They have
            lost their wings entirely.</p>
        <p>Other crickets have evolved down an opposite path, becoming better flyers. Large herbivores, some exhibiting
            bio-mimicry to resemble leaves or twigs, others known as <strong>florgusts</strong> with giant
            brightly-patterned wings, flutter through forests and chomp on leaves. Species have diverged which take
            alternate food sources, including fruit and nectar. On the plains powerful jumpers reminiscent of
            grasshoppers have evolved. They typically have well-developed wings as well and some are migratory,
            following rains to ever-greener pastures. Though their numbers are normally small, like locusts<strong> they
                may periodically explode into plagues when conditions are right</strong> with potentially catastrophic
            consequences to grazing animals, but producing a flush of food to insectivorous birds.</p>
        <p>Crickets have also adapted to more generalized cockroach-like niches, omnivores that scurry through the leaf
            litter of forests and eat decomposing organic matter. <strong>From this group has also arisen a lineage of
                raptorial predators </strong>that catch other insects in sharply-clawed forelegs.</p>
        <p>Some crickets combine behaviors of several of the above groups - spending many years underground as blind,
            wingless nymphs feeding on roots, they may molt periodically into winged and sighted adults, all at once,
            and take flight as a swarm to feed and breed for only a few weeks every ten or twenty years.</p>
        <h2>Beetles</h2>
        <p><strong>Ladybird beetles</strong> have diversified, including the <strong>cuckoo</strong> ladybirds whose
            larvae have become almost indistinguishable from those of the ants they predate, but the ants are not always
            such unwitting surrogates anymore. Whenever a beetle becomes too aggressive in parasitizing an ant the ants
            realize something is wrong and tend to become wise to the trick and finds the imposters, <strong>killing
                them but unintentionally selecting for baby beetles that are even more similar to their own
                babies</strong>. Eventually, the larval beetle is so indistinguishable from its own infants that the
            workers can't find it. The parasites proliferate, eating up their hosts rightful young, until the colony may
            eventually collapse. Fortunately for the cuckoo ladybird, there is still an almost limitless number of other
            naive species to pass its young off on with only a slight change of perfume needed to mimic the new
            "adopters' scent and trick them into adopting the killer baby. The larvae now don't look exactly like those
            of this species, for they were adapted to mimic another which has either died out or become too uncommon for
            the beetle to bother with. The cycle thus repeats, with the beetle larvae coming to look more and more like
            its hosts until either the ants end up caring for nothing but a nursery of killers, which eventually molt in
            beetles and leave the colony vacant of labor and doomed to die, or oppositely the ant becomes completely
            wise to the beetle's game and able to detect the slightest difference in the parasitic larva, becoming
            intolerant of any of them. Unfortunately, the latter scenario can also go another way; in a desperate
            attempt to save their colony, <strong>worker ants can become confused, killing and mutilating every single
                larva indiscriminately, including their own</strong>, and doing themselves in in an ironic twist of
            fate.</p>
        <p><strong>Burying beetles</strong> have produced a wider variety of descendants that fill
            different niches. Some eat the dung of birds, others have become more mobile flyers that lay their eggs in
            carrion without burying it, like flies. Fast-running sorts have become active predators on the forest floor.
        </p>
        <p>There are few herbivorous beetles on Serina, with crickets and ants filling most of these niches, though the
            larva of some burying beetles have adapted to feed on plant matter underground.</p>
        <h2>Mites</h2>
        <p>The small biting <strong>mites</strong> introduced to Serina very quickly swell to larger sizes, some
            becoming tick-like. Active predators appear from the detritivores, giving honor to their relatives on Earth,
            the spiders, as true hunters. Proper web-building has not evolved, <strong>but varieties exist which shoot
                their victims with silken threads to snare them</strong> and then reel them in to kill with a venomous
            bite.</p>
        <h2>Crustaceans</h2>
        <p><strong>Copepods </strong> are now major players in Serina's sea as they are on Earth, forming a significant
            percentage of zooplankton. A myriad of almost microscopic species occur in such numbers as to be all but
            impossible to estimate near the water's surface, feeding on microscopic algae and forming the basis to the
            marine food chain. <strong>They have also produced larger forms, however, several inches in length</strong>,
            which shoal like krill in enormous numbers, feeding on the zooplankton and themselves being fed upon by
            fish, seabirds, and of course the majestic birdwhales. </p>
        <p><strong>Shrimps</strong> descended so long ago from the diminutive, freshwater <em>Neocaridina</em> are also
            diverse, ranging from free-swimming krill-like varieties to large predatory prawns, <strong>one group of
                which is experimenting with gliding out of water to escape its own predators</strong>, using wing-like
            paddles derived from one pair of its legs. They're omnipresent at sea and in inland waters along with the
            generally more armored and less mobile crayfishes, <strong>which are beginning to give rise to short-tailed
                crab-like representatives as well as giant oceanic lobsters</strong> and primitive burrowers. </p>
        <p><strong>Hermit crabs</strong> are universally abundant in the shallow sees and warm beaches near the equator.
            Only aquatic forms were introduced, but some quickly re-developed a fondness for land. <strong>Some have
                gone so far as to leave the beach and move into the subtropical forests, going to water only to breed,
                and then in freshwater pools rather than the sea</strong>. They begin to forgo a larval stage, hatching
            into miniature versions of the adults which are aquatic for their first few months until they too leave the
            water. To survive the cold in more seasonal climes, some burrow.</p>
        <p><strong>Triops</strong> are effectively unchanged, common across Serina's driest environments, <strong>doing
                the same thing they've done so well for now over 350 million years.</strong></p>
        <h2>Molluscs and Cnidarians</h2>
        <p><strong>Snails</strong> are still numerous, but on land they will never again reach the sizes they did in
            Serina's first few thousand years - predators now abound. <strong>In the water they are preyed upon by large
                prawns with powerful claws which find the weak points in their shells, smashing them open; on land
                specialized ants do the task,</strong> chewing away the "hinges" of the door-like structure the snail
            closes to seal itself inside and carrying the shells underground to use to shelter their eggs and larvae -
            but the snails are not totally without defense. Some small arboreal species, when pressed by their ant
            predators, can vault themselves off a branch with an explosive pop of their "door", falling to safety
            somewhere lower in the canopy. When the danger is gone, they emerge and crawl back up a different tree.</p>
        <p>Grazing <strong>sea slugs</strong> still grow to larger sizes than they ever have on Earth in Serina's warm
            waters, some as big as manatees, where they feed on algae and other water plants. They survive in a world of
            keen-eyed hunters, despite being almost blind, by being extraordinarily poisonous. Their danger makes them
            beautiful, however, brightly colored and tasseled with strange display structures, floating silently through
            the shallows like aliens from another world. Some forms have developed sharp stinging tendrils that coat
            their backs - an armor impermeable to any predator, but to which a handful of specialized fish have forged
            an alliance with. Protected by thick mucous on their bodies, squat little platyfishes called
            <strong>daredevils</strong> make the backs of the slugs their home, much like a more mobile version of the
            clownfish/anemone symbiosis on Earth. As the slug swims around and searches for food it disturbs a constant
            stream of small zooplankton as it pulls up the plants from the sand - <strong>a feast the daredevils quickly
                zip out to catch before darting back to the safety of their deadly abode</strong>.</p>
        <p><strong>Bivalves</strong> have become Serina's first reef-builders, <strong>the calcified shells and the
                resinous glue they use to attach themselves to the sediment with forming lasting underwater mountains of
                limestone. </strong>Forming only where currents bring nutrients to near-shore environments, they are
            less common than coral-based reefs which can survive anywhere the sun shines brightly enough, but where they
            do occur they produce an exceptionally rich community of plants and animals. Living clams attach in great
            numbers at the top of the reef and from there they filter feed, adhering to the shells of many generations
            of their deceased elders, while plants and algae also gain a foothold, even on the shells of the living
            bivalves themselves, while generation's of hollowed-out shells provide a deep, labyrinth-like shelter in the
            heart of the reef for a wide variety of aquatic animals to make their homes. Oceanic <strong>hydra</strong>
            have developed forms likely similar to the ancestors of coral and anemonies; much larger than their early
            ancestor, they attach to the tops of the reef with their own calcified crampons and compete with the clams
            for zooplanton as it floats by, with some of the larger species feeding on fish. Many varieties blossom like
            flowers at the tops of the reef, their tissue colored brightly with photosynthetic algae, as they slowly
            reduce their ability to actively feed and rely predominately on energy taken from their new symbiotic
            partners. <strong>In the coming eons, these cnidarians are likely to displace the bivalves as Serina's main
                reef builders and converge further upon their distant Earth relatives, the corals.</strong></p>
        <p><em>Hydra</em> have also evolved more mobile descendants. <strong>Radially symmetrical, flattened hydras
                develop a convergent appearance and behavior to the starfish</strong>, crawling over the sea floor,
            their mouths turned down to the sand, as they hunt actively for small animal prey - the difference being
            once they find it they ensnare it in a mesh of venomous tentacles. <strong>Jellyfish</strong>, the hydra's
            distant relatives, have so far undergone few major innovations, their ancestral habits being as suitable
            today as tens of millions of years ago. </p>
