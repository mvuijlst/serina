        <h1>Serilopes</h1>
        <p>We are now 15 million years into the Cryocene. 65 million years PE, the global climate on Serina has changed
            little since the start of the era, but life continues to evolve.</p>
        <p>Aardgeese continue to diversify, <strong>and are now almost uncontestedly the dominant megafuna group on land
                over Serina's eastern landmass</strong>, as well as being ecologically diverse, if less monopolizing, in
            the west. High levels of competition between the different flightless canaries, both vivas and other groups,
            continues to produce waves of new radiation, as new groups diverge with increasingly complex specializations
            that give them just a little bit more of an edge against their competitors. The earliest aardgeese were
            flightless, cursorial grazing canaries which evolved within just a few million years on Serina's lush grassy
            plains. They swallowed leaves, seeds, and strips of grass whole, tearing and pulling with a serrated bill,
            and practiced <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindgut_fermentation" rel="nofollow">hind-gut
                fermentation</a> to digest it all. This primitive method of plant digestion is less efficient than
            rumination but worked well for breaking down the coarsest plant foods, such as dry grass, and allow the
            animal to survive on a diet of lower quality than other herbivores could, by letting them constantly take in
            small quantities of food throughout the day. <strong>The earliest aardgeese were thus mainly grazing
                animals, and had to spend almost all of their waking hours feeding to survive.</strong></p>
        <p>The aardgeese in turn gave rise the vivas, which appeared now 40 million years ago in Serina's east. Defined
            by the co-evolution of internal egg incubation and a primitive chewing ability, resultant from scraping a
            ridged tongue against the roof of the mouth, which improved their ability to digest tough plant foods, they
            too were herbivores, entirely flightless and well-adapted to run. <strong>They developed more efficient
                digestive systems and chambered stomachs and the ability to ruminate, regurgitating food back to the
                mouth and chewing it multiple times</strong>, just as mammals as diverse as deer, giraffes, and even
            kangaroos - which also evolved the behavior independently - do on Earth, <strong>which no longer required
                they feed quite as often</strong>. The first vivas evolved as browsers, but some of their descendants
            reverted to grazing behaviors. Unlike ancestral aardgeese however, they were now more selective.
            <strong>Rather than feed on large quantities of whatever they could find, like a horse, they picked and
                chose only the most tender bits and the newest growth</strong>. Many Earth ruminants have similar
            tastes, such as gazelles and wildebeest, which despite being advanced ruminants do still feed on grass, but
            in different ways then the zebras they coexist with.</p>
        <p>By fifty million years PE, the vivas in turn had radiated significantly away from this ancestral niche and
            produced not only a myriad of new grazers and primitive browsers, but also omnivores and even a group of
            obligate carnivores, the <strong>raptorial banshees</strong>, which in multiple environments across Serina's
            east out-competed other predators despite being heavily adapted as herbivores due to the much more efficient
            method of rearing their eggs which the group had evolved compared to other birds - a great advantage in cold
            climates. In the common ancestor of the omnivorous group which diversified into animals as distinct as the
            banshees and the shimmersnoot, the chambered, complex stomach rapidly and dramatically reduced in size and
            length, for a diet of animal protein is easily broken down and indeed can sour if it stays in a lengthy
            digestive system for too long. Carnivorous vivas did not lose their modified chewing tongues, though -
            rather, <strong>in the banshees, the organ became armored in barbed spines, a tool perfect to strip flesh
                from bones</strong> - <strong>while in the shimmersnoot it became a bony implement to pulverize
                mouthfuls of ants and break up their exoskeletons before swallowing them.</strong></p>
        <p>Now sixty five million years have passed since the canaries were introduced, and the vivas have given rise to
            another highly successful lineage, the <strong>serilopes</strong>. Serilopes evolved initially as one of
            those selective grazers just touched upon above, and<strong> notably have evolved the most efficient chewing
                apparatus as yet evolved in any bird.</strong> The tongue is large, strong, and highly muscular with a
            bony core, and is covered upon its upper surface in a series of keratinous plates which mimic molars and
            grind in a circular motion against a series of similar plates that cover the roof of the mouth. <strong>As
                an advantage over mammals' teeth, the serilope's tongue and jaw plates don't wear out, as they
                constantly grow outwards as they are worn down through the process of chewing</strong>. To prevent food
            from falling from the mouth, and allow the serilope to chew, swallow, and then regurgitate mouthfuls of food
            to chew again as it ruminates, <strong>they have evolved fleshy cheeks that run along most of their
                jaw</strong>. The jaws are almost completely soft and fleshy, with gums where once was a hard beak, save
            for multiple rows of tooth-like keratin plates in the upper jaw. Indeed, while the beak of most vivas still
            covers most of both jaws, on serilopes it now only covers the very distal edge of the jaws and functions
            only to crop plant material, like a set of incisor teeth. Serilopes evolved in the northern plains of
            Serina's eastern continent but rapidly spread southwards and now occur across the entire continent.</p>

        <p>Serilopes were the first canaries to produce true live birth, but the retaining of the eggs inside the
            mother's body until after hatching - a seemingly simple step that marks the final culmination of the process
            of internal incubation - <strong>will over time occur in other viva lineages.</strong></p>
