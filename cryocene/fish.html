        <h1>Fish out of Water: Mudwickets and Eelsnakes</h1>
        <p><strong>Mudwickets</strong>, a group of semi-terrestrial guppies that first appeared about 25 million years
            ago, <strong>have diversified enormously since the middle Tempuscenic</strong>, despite a cooling climate.
            Found across the subtropical belt in Serina's east, where Striata meets Whalteria, these formerly
            water-bound fishes have begun to totally cut their ties to the water. Many mudwickets now live entirely on
            land, in the soggy leaf litter of forests and jungles or in deep burrows in drier environments. Their
            pectoral fins have become well suited to digging, with five exceptionally large claw-like rays. So long as
            they can keep moist, they needn't ever actually submerge in water anymore and oxygen is absorbed through all
            of their skin right out of the air, including that of the gill membranes, but particularly the mouth, which
            is brilliantly red with oxygenating tissue. <strong>As guppies the mudwickets breed internally, with the
                male using the <a href="https://www.theaquariumwiki.com/Gonopodium" rel="nofollow">gonopodium fin</a>
                located under his tail to transfer sperm directly into the female's body and to her ovaries</strong>,
            negating totally the need for water even to breed, as amphibians require. The young can move on land from
            infancy and are usually born in burrows. Some species are protected by the parents for a short time after
            birth until they leave to begin hunting on their own.</p>

        </figure>
        <p>Mudwickets are strange looking animals, with bulbous eyes, often wide grinning mouths, and colorful
            dorsal fins on their backs. Their jaws are extendable and full of needle-sharp teeth, for they are all
            carnivores, and males in particular are aggressive and showy creatures, battling over territory and
            flaring fins and brightly colored jaws and gill covers to intimidate one another and attract the
            attention of smaller females. Tough though they are in demeanor, they are squat and chubby creatures and
            ungainly at best in locomotion, and their battles often involve nothing more than pushing against one
            another until one or both roll over. They can pull themselves along with their clawed pectoral fins
            underground, while above ground <strong>they rely on thrusts of their squat but still well-muscled tails
                to produce short hops.</strong> The tail now lacks a fin and is specialized to the task of
            propulsion over land, curving to the side and ending in a flattened pad of rough scales to get traction
            on the ground. Mudwickets may be either right-tailed, with their tail twisting to the right, or
            left-tailed, and this determines which way the most effectively jump - though neither is particularly
            good at aiming for an exact perch. Most species spend most of their time underground, feeding on small
            worms, grubs, and other such beasties, and rarely move around over land during the day, preferring to do
            so in the dark when their avian predators are less active. Unfortunately, one group of animals which has
            recently appeared on the world of birds doesn't share the same preferences of time to hunt.
            <strong>Slithering quietly out of forest pools and streams with a side to side slinking motion through
                the moss and liverworts, the eelsnake searches for food.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Eelsnakes</strong> are elongated eel-shaped swordtail fishes, one to two feet in length,
            <strong>which have evolved to hunt on land as well as in the water.</strong> Taking in atmospheric
            oxygen via a lung-like bladder budding off their stomachs, they too can stay out of water indefinitely
            as long as they stay relatively moist. Spending the day resting at the bottom of pools, tangled in
            vegetation and occasionally striking out at some small pasing prey item, they do most of their hunting
            on land. Traveling by night when the ground is moist with dew does the trick to ensure they don't get
            too dry while they're at it, as the hunters emerge in groups from the water like shimmering rubber ropes
            and quickly disappear into the undergrowth. They shuffle their heads around this way and that, showing
            off an exceptionally mobile neck for a fish. They press their snouts deep into the mud and inhale every
            few feet, sniffing around in search of their preferred prey; earthworms, slugs...<i> and mudwickets</i>.
            Their eyes which work well underwater are a bit blurry on land, but the eelsnake has an excellent sense
            of smell, heightened by a pair of short barbels that carry scent particles right up to the nostrils from
            the ground, and it can easily follow the scents of the small creatures it hungers for deep down
            underground by merit of its flexible, sinuous body. </p>
        <figure><img src="images/ctzXhiu.jpg" alt="eelsnake" />
            <figcaption>eelsnake slithers over a forest floor
                in search of food</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>When the eelsnake finds something in the burrow, it strikes quickly and aggressively, wrapping its highly
            elastic jaws around the prey and positioning it via its long, backwards-curved teeth into a position to
            be swallowed whole, headfirst for vertebrate prey. The mudwicket may struggle, inflating its body with
            air and thrashing with its claws, but it's no use. Unable to cry out without vocal cords, the only sound
            it can make as its tail slips down the hungry hunter's gullet is the faint squeak of the air it just
            inhaled being compressed out of its body. It may struggle for a while in the eelsnake's stomach, while
            it turns around in the burrow and makes its way - a little more slowly - back to its pool to digest.
            Eventually without oxygen in the predator's stomach, the prey is suffocated and the eelsnake slides back
            into the water, making its way back to a cozy tangle of water weeds to rest. A large meal can satiate it
            for a week, but before long it will be back on the shore, in search of another course.</p>
        <p>Originally most mudwickets were quite defenseless to predators such as the eelsnake, relying on
            camouflage and the safety of their burrows alone to avoid predation - and still often being taken by
            birds and other animals... until some developed a new line of defense. <strong>Poison, concentrated in
                their skin and scales from a diet of the noxious ants and other insects that are so numerous in
                Serina's forests, proved a successful deterrent to predators</strong>. An eelsnake that bit into a
            neurotoxic mudwicket wouldn't get a chance to try to do so again... but neither would the mudwicket,
            already swallowed down the predator's gullet. To the protection of both parties involved, one group of
            highly toxic mudwickets armed itself with vibrant warning coloration, bold and contrasting splotches of
            blue, yellow, black and red, biological signs yelling loudly and clearly "I am deadly!". The "poison
            dart" mudwickets were born. Just like their frog analogues in the rainforest back on Earth, predators
            steer far clear of any squat little creature hopping unperturbed on the forest floor while wearing the
            cloak of colored death. Some of the brightly colored mudwickets, no longer having predators to fear,
            have become diurnal. Others have lost many of their burrowing adaptations, no longer needing to hide to
            survive. And hitching a ride on the band wagon, a fair few harmless mudwickets, with completely
            innocuous diets, have developed mimicry of their poisonous kin to avoid predators without actually being
            toxic at all.</p>
