        <h1>Bamboo Diversity of the Cryocene</h1>
        <p>By the start of the Cryocene, <strong>bamboo</strong> has become one of Serina's most successful plant groups
            and makes
            up entire forest communities in some subtropical equatorial habitats. Fast-growing, hardy and adaptable
            already in its ancestral form, it has begun to evolve in several new directions by fifty million years PE.
        </p>
        <figure> <img src="images/TlhcAEO.png" alt="four groups of bamboo" /> </figure>
        <p>Illustrated above are examples of the growth habits of four groups of bamboo present on Serina by this time,
            labeled<strong> A, B, C,</strong> and <strong>D</strong>. <strong>A is the ancestral plant from which B, C,
                and D descend</strong> and
            grows individual bamboo canes directly from a large underground rhizome, which can spread almost
            indefinitely in any direction via underground stems. This ability to quickly spread across Serina in its
            early history initially gave bamboo an advantage over most other plant groups, though this rate of spread
            was only possible in very fertile and wet climates. Bamboo forests of this growth habit typically grew and
            spread for a lengthy period of time, anywhere from a few decades to over one hundred years, before
            flowering, dying, and slowly regenerating over the next ten to twenty years from seedlings - a habit
            retained in many Serinan species today, including the desert bamboo, which takes this behavior to its
            extreme. <strong>The individual canes of these colonies are short-lived, lasting only a few years, and are
                typically determinate in growth; they can only grow to a certain height before they stop
                developing.</strong>
            To keep the plant growing, new canes are constantly produced from the root system to replace those which
            die. The roots are shallow, without deep anchoring tap roots. </p>
        <p><strong>Over time, however, mutant populations of bamboo would gradually arise with less aggressive rates of
                spreading, but which concentrated more of their energy on producing fewer but larger, taller, and
                longer-lived individual stems (B).</strong> Their growth rate was slower, but it was indeterminate -
            given
            time, they could grow larger than their competitors, with canes that last much longer. This was the first
            step to reaching a more tree-like shape and growth pattern and was particularly beneficial in drier
            ecosystems or those where the soil was fairly poor in nutrients. By concentrating on just a few trunks and
            increasing its size more gradually, a plant could better grow in less ideal environments, including in the
            shadow of more vigorous type-A bamboo colonies. <strong>Biding their time on what little nutrition they can
                get
                that the more aggressive bamboo doesn't suck up around them, they can eventually grow beyond the canopy
                and slowly shade out their competition. </strong>B-type bamboo still produce canes from the underground
            root
            but far fewer than the ancestral bamboo and much closer to the main trunk, resulting in a small clump of
            trees together rather than a sprawling colony. <strong>In the natural pattern of forest succession, B-type
                bamboo
                forest tend to gradually replace A-type forests over the course of about a century, for though type-A
                bamboo is quick to colonize open land, by the time it flowers, the ground will be too shaded by maturing
                type-B bamboo for most of their seedlings to survive.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Next is the type-C growth pattern. An extension of type-B, this bamboo produces only one trunk and
                few or
                no secondary canes. </strong>Its rhizome is reduced, and it instead produces a single deep taproot to
            probe
            the soil for water and deeply buried minerals. Its growth is perhaps the slowest of all, but it is the only
            type which can reliably take root and survive on dry exposed hillsides or areas with little soil. Its
            singular trunk can become several meters wide, though remains hollow and never becomes woody like a proper
            tree; the only living tissue within it occurs in a ring-shaped cross section. This makes a type-C bamboo
            "tree" lighter than a woody plant like a sunflower tree, which makes it potentially more vulnerable to high
            wind or weather when young but considerably less likely to topple over under their own weight at very large
            sizes. The first representative of a "type-C" bamboo was the monovitus tree of the middle Tempuscenic. Like
            this ancestor, many modern examples still flower only once, often at a very advanced age, in such an
            extravagant show that they use up all their energy and die back to give their offspring a chance to grow in
            their place. Others however have become truly indeterminate growers, growing throughout their life and
            flowering less abundantly but much more frequently, even every year, producing fewer seeds at a time but
            surely many more over the course of a longer lifetime. In the case of trees that don't die back after
            flowering, methods to ensure their seeds get far enough away that they don't compete with their parent have
            had to evolve, and the descendants of the monovitus tree use their symbiotic ants. Now not only do these
            ants live within their tissues, prune away competitors, and clean them of insect pests, but they disperse
            their seeds for them across wide reaches of land, each new queen taking a seed with it when it flies away to
            start its own new colony. It finds a suitable sunny patch of soil and begins to dig a burrow for its new
            colony, taking the seed underground. When it sprouts they instinctively guard it and keep its patch of soil
            weeded, and when it is big enough, it begins to grow swollen bolls at its nodes which the ants then move
            into. A single colony will stay with a tree for up to twenty years - the maximum lifespan of certain queen
            ants, but eventually a queen will die and the colony will collapse. Fortunately for the tree, however, it
            takes very little time for another young queen to move in and start the cycle again - indeed, so valuable is
            a mature tree as a nest site that dozens of queens will fight for the right to use it. Several may even
            start nesting at different heights within its trunk, but eventually the colonies will meet and battle. That
            with the largest army always wins. <strong>Because Type-C bamboo doesn't reproduce asexually at all and only
                spreads via seeds, it has a higher rate of mutation than other bamboos, giving it improved resistance to
                pathogens and a better ability to adapt to changing environmental conditions than bamboos that only
                rarely reproduce sexually.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Type C bamboo has taken the ant symbiosis to its greatest pinnacle so far by the start of the
                Cryocene,
                being entirely dependent on certain ant species to reproduce,</strong> but representatives from all
            growth
            types provide ants with shelter and sometimes food in exchange for keeping them free of pests and
            competition. Type-A bamboo is the least dependent on them, however, for it grows the most aggressively
            already that it can compete against most other plants well enough by itself that its symbiotes are simply
            extra help. <strong>The ancestral type-A bamboo's rapid growth may in fact have been a contributing factor
                in
                later slower-growing species adopting the help of ants in the first place</strong>, for they could
            counteract
            their less vigorous biology if their helpers pruned away other plants from around them before they were
            overtaken. Eventually, however, the more vigorous bamboo would begin to attract ants of their own
            specifically for the purpose of putting the odds back in their favor. Today hundreds of bamboo species exist
            with many more symbiotic ant species, all fighting a largely hidden battle for turf against each other,
            trimming away the branches of their neighbors if any two plants get too close to each other. <strong>The
                Serinan
                bamboo forest exhibits universal <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crown_shyness"
                    rel="nofollow">crown shyness</a> to a particularly obvious degree, because anywhere that the
                branches of two different trees with different ant colonies touch is soon pruned away by the ants living
                on one or the other.</strong></p>
        <p class="asterism">&#8258;</p>
        <p><strong>Type-D bamboo is the result of an entirely different evolutionary path.</strong> A mutation has
            occurred in
            these plants that results in two very different methods of growth in a single plant. Canes rise up from the
            rhizome and expand their mass from the top, adding whorls of leaves and gaining in height by building
            upwards like almost every other plant, but this type of bamboo also grows <i>from the bottom up</i>, random
            sections of the rhizomes gradually lengthening underground until they rise out of the soil, in some places
            as high as ten meters, raising the bases of the plant's canes up with it, from under the ground to quite a
            ways above the soil. In this way, Type-D bamboo - which is otherwise very similar in its manner of growth to
            type-A bamboo - is able to reach much greater heights, as it becomes supported by multiple woody trunks in
            its old age and towers above its competition that doesn't exhibit the mutation. Of all the bamboos so far to
            evolve, only this one could be called a tree in the strictest of sense, for with its elevated rhizome, it
            could be said to have a proper solid trunk. Canes still die back frequently and re-sprout from the trunk,
            but with the rhizome now high above the forest floor, they don't need to struggle up through the shaded
            understory and can grow in the sun from the start. </p>
        <p>Nonetheless, though type-D bamboo is more competitive in dense forest environments than type-A bamboo,
            <strong>it's much less suited to colonizing open expanses of land,</strong> for when its rhizome rises out
            of the
            soil, the canes that grow from it lose their rooting and become wobbly and vulnerable to being broken off.
            In the forest they can lean on their neighbors for support but in exposed areas they typically blow over in
            the wind once the rhizome breaks out of the soil and its stabilizing presence on the shoots. The two bamboo
            types have thus begun to niche partition, Type-D thriving in forests and type-A in open environments.
            <strong>Because Type-D cannot survive except in a forest environment of mostly type-A bamboo to support it,
                however, its long-term survival is linked with the other growth type</strong>, meaning that in order to
            continue to survive, it must remain competitive, but not to the point of totally outdoing its competitors,
            for in an ironic twist, <strong>it needs them to survive itself.</strong></p>
        <p>Type-D, like type-A, <strong>eventually flowers and dies back to the ground as well</strong>, and is
            succeeded just
            like it by types B and C in a healthy forest community. <strong>The final climax trees to dominate a forest
                in
                the end, however, are usually not bamboo at all</strong>; they are slow-growing, long-lived sunflowers,
            which
            may spend decades biding their time in the shade before emerging to take their place in the canopy. </p>
