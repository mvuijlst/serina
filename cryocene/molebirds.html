        <h1>Molebirds</h1>
        <p><strong>Molebirds</strong> are a locally abundant but isolated group of burrowing finches directly descended
            from the ground serins which can only be found in the southern half of North Anciska in the Cryocene. In the
            fifty million years since we last left off, evolutionary process has substantially reshaped and refined the
            basal canaries from an unspecialized relic reliant on the burrows of another animal to survive, into a
            capable digger in their own right. The ancient symbiosis of its ancestors with early burrowing crickets
            gradually dissolved as Anciska's climate became colder and its deserts gradually became replaced by
            grasslands and recently broad-leaf forests, with the crickets becoming increasingly adapted to a life wholly
            underground and independent of the surface - and thus no no longer reliant on the birds' keen eyesight to
            avoid aerial predators. Nonetheless, <strong>the canaries stayed with their symbionts, making use of their
                tunnels, long after the crickets required them, and over time they too developed their own adaptation to
                burrow.</strong> Their wings reduced to muscular arms suited to pulling themselves through tunnels and
            pushing aside soil, but unlike the bumblets - a burrowing viva group which utilize their wings to burrow -
            <strong>it was their beak that became their shovel</strong>. It began to grow continuously, replacing
            keratin that was worn away in chipping at the soil, and both jaws became sharply pointed and aligned to
            grind together like the teeth of a rodent.</p>
        <figure><img alt="molebirds" src="images/zlauh83.png" />
            <figcaption><strong>above:</strong> a pair of molebirds; the majority of species are difficult if not
                impossible to identify physically, distinguished only by differences in vocalization.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>The feet became oversize and positioned far back on the body, useful to kick away loosened soil, while the
            eyes dwindled until they were so small as to leave their owner virtually blind. <strong>They followed their
                partners into the dark depths, never to return</strong>, in pursuit of nutritious roots, tubers, and
            insect larvae that they searched out with a newly redeveloped sense of smell. <strong>The soil provided
                shelter and stability in a cooling climate, and a safe and warm place to nest</strong> in almost any
            season, provided they went down deep enough. While their flying kin were forced to migrate southwards ever
            winter, the ground serins sought refuge much closer to home and avoided the harshest cold by simply
            burrowing to a depth where it didn't reach. Avoiding the most polar environments, where permafrost makes
            burrowing difficult, they thrive in the broad band of land between the southern coast and the tundra, busily
            tunneling out their largely secretive existence beneath meadows and forests and almost never coming
            intentionally to the surface. <strong>They have become extraordinarily efficient respirators</strong>, able
            to survive anoxic conditions in deep underground tunnels that would suffocate a human, as well as to allow
            them to roost and breed down and out of reach of most of their potential predators such as the large
            predatory mole crickets that can only get enough oxygen to support them just below the surface.
            Unfortunately the molebird cannot entirely cut off the surface world, for at least in the summer when it
            must forage daily for food, it must spend a substantial amount of its time in shallow tunnels very close to
            the surface and in reach of the roots or invertebrates it feeds on;<strong> it is here that the crickets may
                lie in wait and ambush them.</strong> In winter they are usually safe, for the crickets - unable to
            survive at the same anoxic depths as the molebird due to their less efficient respiration - must hibernate
            to survive the cold.</p>
        <figure><img alt="burrowing cricket and molebird" src="images/1CXiLFK.png" />
            <figcaption><strong>above:</strong> Once friends, now foes, these two old partners have definitely grown
                apart over
                the years; a blind carnivorous burrowing cricket snares in its claws a molebird as it forages near the
                surface. </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Additionally for a few nights in the spring, <strong>the molebird is forced to leave its refuge entirely in
                order to find a mate</strong>; on cloudy nights as the ground begins to thaw, they emerge in small
            groups all across the land and crawl above the ground on their bellies. <strong>Males emerge first and sing
                a raspy chirping song not unlike a cricket's</strong>, soon drawing attention from the females, which
            then emerge in response. Mating is quick, and a single copulation is usually all that it takes to fertilize
            a female, and <strong>once a pair has coupled they part ways and return underground</strong>, as every
            moment spent above it is a moment they are in danger of being killed by predators; indeed, males have an
            unfortunately self-detrimental tendency to not return to their burrows unless they successfully breed a
            female, instead spending many hours outside the burrow calling even after no more females emerge. As
            predators quickly converge on their conspicuous calls and a molebird is virtually defenseless on land, many
            if not most males that do not breed in the first few moments after nightfall are killed and eaten before
            morning as they call for female company, <strong>ensuring that not only do the least fit in the population
                not breed, but are actively culled,</strong> allowing the future young of the more successful breeders a
            higher availability of food and territory.</p>
