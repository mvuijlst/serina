        <h1>Bloons</h1>
        <p>Fifty million years have passed on the small green moon of Serina since the first canaries were set free upon
            the land. In these long intervening years, a world was built from the barest of foundations to a diverse
            pallet of life today unmatched anywhere in the cosmos. The descendants of Serina's very earliest songbirds
            have today conquered land, air, and sea, filling an ecological vacuum in a world without other tetrapods to
            compete with in ways that our own world has never known.</p>
        <p>One of the most specialized lineages birds of Serina fifty-million years PE are the <strong>Bloons.</strong>
            <strong>Growing to more than sixty feet (18 meters) in length and weighing up to fifteen thousand pounds
                (6800 kg)</strong> they are a family of gentle, herbivorous leviathans, the largest birds to have ever
            so far existed, which make their existences as Serina's analog to sea cows across the moons' tropical seas,
            where they graze upon immense undersea meadows of kelp and sea grass, eating up to a thousand pounds of it
            in a days' time. Several times too heavy to leave the water and with their hind limbs all but vestigial,
            fused to their pygostyles, these easy-going, wing-powered swimmers spend their entire lives at sea, from
            hatching to death. This is possible because while like all birds so far to evolve at this time, the bloons
            must lay hard-shelled calcified eggs - eggs that cannot survive prolonged immersion in seawater -
            <strong>they belong to an ingenious order of sea birds which have found a unique and exceptional method of
                caring for their eggs which requires no visitation to the shore in the form of mouth-brooding.</strong>

        <p>Mouth-brooding - at its simplest meaning to protect the eggs or young from predators by hiding them in the
            mouth, is a relatively common behavior in many fishes and even some tetrapods. The reproductive behavior of
            the bloons however marks a first in birds; in these species and their relatives, it exists as a
            highly-derived behavior originating from an ancestral tendency to protect the young chicks from danger or
            keep them warm by <strong>carrying and holding them in a pouch below the bill</strong> which likely first
            appeared more than thirty million years ago in the bloons' pelican-like ancestors. Once this was
            well-established over time, it was not a large step to also hold the eggs themselves there, for being able
            to transport ones' unhatched young - which virtually no other bird is known to do, even though the behavior
            is commonplace in mammals and even crocodillians - proved a highly beneficial behavior for a large seabird
            which nested increasingly far from land and upon less and less stable mats of plant material in the manner
            of a grebe, pushed from more choice breeding locations ashore by rampant predators and competitors on the
            world of birds. With eggs in this situation likely to roll into the water at the slightest mishap, evolution
            favored those eggs both most tolerant to brief immersion, <strong>with large and buoyant air pockets and
                waxy eggshell cuticles less easily permeated by seawater</strong> and behaviorally, <strong>those birds
                which as breeding adults would still recognize their own eggs outside the perimeter of a chosen
                nest</strong> - which very few birds today can - and further, which were both willing and able to return
            lost eggs to the nest if they were to fall out. </p>
        <p>As this novel egg retrieval behavior developed, and the parent bird's mouth evolved to be increasingly
            well-suited to the transport of both eggs and young - and furthermore, as one group of pouched piscivores
            became too large and ungainly to easily sit upon any manner of floating nest - <strong>they began to
                incubate their single eggs directly upon their own soft, feathered backs.</strong> By taking turns to
            transfer the egg between them and covering it by turning the head over their shoulder and inverting the
            warm, soft skin of the throat pouch over-top this home-grown "nest", they found a new way to provide the
            developing eggs with safety, warmth and humidity independent of any true nest site at all. This was
            effective, but for the most part required the protection of colonial breeding in isolated calm, shallow
            waters to truly work out, and so from here it was not long before one group was to eventually forego the use
            of any nest entirely and begin to hold the eggs directly within the confines of this specialized throat
            pouch at all times, <strong>the organ having over time evolved to become watertight and independent of the
                digestive system and the rest of the gizzard.</strong> This freed the adults to move freely whilst
            incubating and more importantly hid the vulnerable egg from predators entirely - factors which together
            allowed the birds to develop secondarily less colony-dependent lifestyles and to subsequently diversify
            greatly. Now the male simply plucked the floating eggs from the water as the female dropped them and
            maneuvered them safely and quickly into the specialized organ within his crop to incubate while still
            allowing him to feed himself and keep alert for predators. The egg became increasingly large - <strong>in
                some modern bloons it now approaches twenty pounds in weight</strong> - and insulated by the fat and
            tissue of the neck it is effectively impossible to crack, for a strong enough blow to rupture it would also
            break the adults' neck. Oxygenated every time the adult surfaced to breathe, kept warm and moist within the
            adult's body, in this way the bloons' ancestors developed a roundabout way to nurture their developing young
            within the safety of their bodies and to circumvent the formerly universal avian need to tend a nest on dry
            land. When the chick hatches after just a few months, <strong>it can swim and feed itself from
                birth</strong>, but remains close by its parents for several years, generally protected by merit of
            their great size and highly protective nature. Adults can rear as many as three clutches in a year and as
            chicks do not immediately disperse may be seen to be watching clutches as many as six or sometimes more
            young of various ages at one time. For additional protection, adults frequently form creches with other
            adults of several dozen or more young, guarding them as a herd from a myriad of predators which may lurk the
            shallow coastal seas that the gentle giants roam in hopes of picking off a straggler similarly to many earth
            waterbirds. <strong>Herds of bloons are rarely organized but individual pairs mate for life and good feeding
                grounds can attract loosely-associated gatherings of hundreds or rarely thousands of the animals along
                especially fertile coastlines.</strong></p>
        <p class="asterism">&#8258;</p>
        <p>Bloons are the most specialized member of their order at this period in time, having traded their piscivorous
            tendencies for a diet of green plants and algae and rarely slow-moving invertebrates, all managed by a
            goose-like serrated bill. Most of their relatives retain a more carnivorous diet, with diets ranging from
            small fishes and marine invertebrates up to large seabirds and even bloons themselves. Though they may
            differ greatly in appearance, size, and lifestyle, however, <strong>they can all be allied by their unique
                manner of internal incubation</strong>. In the bloons, this is done entirely by the male, but in smaller
            carnivorous species it is often a joint affair, with pairs regularly transferring the precious cargo between
            them every few days to feed whilst the other parent rests near the surface so as to create a calm and stable
            environment for its developing young. With a more active lifestyle, which in a predator often requires fast
            maneuvering and diving to deep depths, the risk of cracking or damaging the embryo within its pouch is too
            high to allow these animals to feed whilst also carrying the egg as the more sedate, plant-eating bloons -
            which never dive more than a few meters below their clear tropical waters - have the luxury to do. </p>
        <p>Modern bloons have almost wholly lost their plumage and retain only a very thin layer of fuzz over their
            bodies, generally just a few millimeters in length. Too large and bulky to properly preen, they are instead
            insulated by their body fat.</p>
