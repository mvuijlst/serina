        <h1>Tyrant Serins</h1>
        <p>On the connected continents of South Anciska and Stehvlandea, predatory <strong>skykes</strong> - flightless
            fast-running predator canaries - are still abundant and diverse. They range widely in size, from shy,
            hen-sized forest dwellers upwards to some of the world's largest land carnivores, though the majority fall
            somewhere in the middle. They may feed on insects and arthropods, smaller finches, fish, and even other
            large flightless birds, but always use their large beaks to deliver the killing blow. The shape of the bill
            can vary significantly; lanky <strong>Swordbills</strong> grab smaller animals in a straight stork-like bill
            and swallow them whole, while <strong>tyrant serins</strong> have a powerful crushing bite able to shatter
            bone. Small forest dwellers have a tweezer-like beak to pluck insects from tree trunks, while wading species
            spear fish with a long, thin beak suited well for stabbing. Some early skykes, which did not need to run at
            too fast a pace to catch the fairly slow and plodding giant canaries of the hypostecene, lost their wings
            entirely, but this bodyplan wasn't as suited to chasing the faster prey that would gradually evolve soon
            after. All species to survive to the Cryocene descend from a more basal ancestor which kept their wings and
            could balance better during high speed chases, and thus the majority of extant species now retain fairly
            developed forearms and wing plumage. Unlike the banshees, modern skykes are usually endurance hunters;
            rather than leap onto their prey in ambush, they run it down in the open. </p>
        <p>Though smaller skykes survive in the east, the largest and most impressive hunters are endemic to South
            Anciska. <strong>The grandest of all are still members of the tyrant serin group</strong>, specialist
            predators of other large megafauna. They kill their prey by biting into the neck and severing the spinal
            cord, the jugular, or the windpipe with a notched, serrated "tooth" on either side of their upper and lower
            jaws. Some Cryocenic tyrant serins have become veritably gigantic, reaching weights of 3,000 pounds. Lacking
            a proper tail like has reappeared in some of the vivas, they nonetheless do have elongated tail vertebrae
            that serve to lengthen the body somewhat and improve their balance - the rest, however, is dependent on
            their posture. As in most birds other than the vivas, the thighs are fixed forward to set their center of
            gravity further back, and the wings are used to steer. The giant tyrants are able to run at speeds over
            twenty five miles per hour - sufficient to catch the other giant birds they prey on, such as young
            serestriders - but it is the smaller species that really excel in this department. Certain smaller tyrant
            serins have specialized almost as avian cheetahs; compromising between two methods of running not normally
            seen in a single animal on Earth, some are able to reach extraordinary speeds of nearly seventy miles per
            hour in short bursts, but also to run for more extended lengths of time at slower speeds closer to thirty to
            forty miles per hour, depending on the circumstance and behavior of the prey species in question. Others are
            complete endurance hunters, chasing herds of aardgeese in packs and picking off the weak that lag behind.

            <figcaption>
                <p><strong>above:</strong> the <strong>red-fronted tyrant serin</strong>, shown with a pair of commensal
                    strackbirds in tow, is the heaviest skyke ever to live, and the largest land predator anywhere on
                    Serina 65 million years PE. Standing a little more than seven feet at the hip, adult females can
                    reach a length of nineteen feet and weigh one and half tons. Hunting a wide variety of habitats upon
                    South Anciska from the temperate forests to the deserts and the crashing seashore far inland to the
                    dry savannah, they feed predominately on serestriders, picking off the old, young, and ill, but will
                    consume almost anything they can catch, including carrion and ocean refuse. </p <p>Male and female
                are broadly alike save for size; males are only two thirds the size of their partners. They also have
                more white around their eyes, with a brow arcing over the eye and in some subspecies attaching to the
                cheek patch. Females exhibit only a white marking on the cheek and a smaller patch under the eye. Both
                genders exhibit a cap of red plumage on their foreheads.</p>
                <p>Males attract mates and intimidate rivals with infrasonic courtship songs. Though inaudible to human
                    ears these follow a similar range of sound to that of the modern canary, simply at a far lower
                    pitch.</p>
