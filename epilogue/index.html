        <h1>Epilogue</h1>
        <p>In 2017 I decided Serina would end after 400 million years. This year I re-evaluated and determined that this
            was too long for the ideas that were established. <strong>Serina now will meet its icy fate not long after
                300 million years.</strong></p>
        <p>But this is still a long time to get through to finish this project officially, and I cannot commit to doing
            so any longer. It may happen. But it probably won&#39;t. Because doing this brings me little joy anymore,
            and I don&#39;t want to resent my creation.</p>
        <p>The broad timeline of Serina&#39;s planned end goes about like this.</p>
        <p><strong>255 million </strong>- biodiverse warm period (current)<br /><strong>280 million </strong>- ice age
            begins<br /><strong>285 million</strong> - near snowball-planet, mass extinction of life on
            land<br /><strong>290 million</strong> - new warm period<br /><strong>315 million</strong> - second ice age
            begins, slower progressing, but this is the final one<br /><strong>320 million</strong> - the death of the
            last bird, and<strong> Serina&#39;s effective end</strong>.</p>
        <p><strong>One thing I wanted to cover still in this current period was the seas.</strong> Ocean life was always
            neglected on Serina, and it is unlikely I will ever actually show more of the seas. Creatures like the
            snarks, lucky to get one post, can be presumed to be still thriving in the Ultimocene. What fish are doing
            we can only guess, though Troll Man conceptualized <strong>an interesting fish that swims via jet propulsion
                through its gill outlets</strong>; this is as canon as any fish concept I have considered, and none of
            mine are as imaginative. He also designed a clade of swimming crabs. Also, in my mind, canon.</p>
        <figure><img alt="" src="images/qRZ3v9i.png"></figure>
        <figure><img alt="" src="images/WGpjVZt.png"></figure>
        <p>I have had this drawing in varying stages of completeness for years at this point.<strong> It depicts a
                pliosaur-like predator burdle, a descendant of the mucks, chasing down a dolphin-like bumblet</strong> -
            a dolfinch or similar species. Both species are extant at 255 million years PE, and both clades successful;
            I invisioned dolfinches being very like the extinct birdwhales by now as filter feeders but what exactly
            does what in each niche has not been determined except that dolfinches are small fish eaters, and burdles
            big predators. I wanted to do large write ups on both clades before posting, but no longer have the
            ambition.</p>
        <figure><img alt="" src="images/lwZjWo8.jpg"></figure>
        <p>There are a few future species I have illustrated, though they are not all exactly accurate to reflect
            changes in their ancestry.<strong> One such species is a large mammoth-like descendant of the
                neckbeard,</strong> living in the coming ice age. Designed before its ancestor, it does not reflect the
            fluffy egg pouch it should have inherited, nor is the predator&#39;s design canon since the revision of how
            circuagodogs look. But it does represent the idea well. This illustration is already nearly 2 years old, and
            appeared on my patreon.</p>
        <figure><img alt="" src="images//sxc2XN4.png"></figure>
        <p><strong>Some clades have been in limbo.</strong> Originally there were several other predatory circuagodonts
            planned to be posted by now, but their designs were retconned after the conceptualization of the
            spider-handed chiseler - designed to be an ancestor of a second predator molodont clade. So they were pushed
            aside, to some undetermined later period, and the new predator circuagodonts which I shared already
            designed. Forms such as the cutthroat were drawn as circuagodonts but now intended to be molodonts; the
            forearm anatomy is thus in need of revision, but otherwise this illustration is effective to convey the
            idea. The cutthroat lives later in the early Ultimocene, shorty before the first ice age, perhaps 265
            million years PE and is a descendant of the chiseler. It is preying on a descendant of the neckbeard.</p>
        <figure><img alt="" src="images/QAd59fV.png"></figure>
        <p><strong>Another clade of chiseler descendants was planned to become bipeds</strong>, lifting their tails off
            the ground. One such form would become the largest land predator, hunting boomsingers and those mammoth
            birds shown above, its jaws evolved into a veritable bone saw. Never given a name or an exact scale, it was
            at least 15 feet tall. Like the cutthroat, it was first drawn as a circuagodont, so its anatomy as a
            chiseler is slightly off and would need corrections if it ever got posted on the site. </p>
        <figure><img alt="" src="images/D11UHTX.jpg"></figure>
        <p>Another descendant of the molodonts, an idea given to me by <strong>Sphenodon</strong>,<strong> was one which
                evolved its teeth into a syringe and fed on blood. </strong>The tweezertoothed glider&#39;s jaws, posted
            again below, show the process that this would have evolved from, as it has already developed a pinching
            motion that would have given rise to a forward and back-sliding needle jaw in a<strong> vampire-like
                descendant of that specie</strong>s living before the ice age. A real animation or drawing of the
            concept is unfortunately now very unlikely. </p>
        <figure><img alt="" src="images/r63jcbU.gif"></figure>
        <p>>There was also an extant concept for a saber-toothed circuagodog, inspired by the jaws of tiger beetles,
            with scissor-like upper and lower teeth that met asymmetrically, allowing it a very wide bite without
            sacrificing jaw strength. I found it too difficult to animate and convey without a 3D model, and it was
            scrapped.</p>
        <figure><img alt="" src="images/6i5cGCa.png"></figure>
        <h2>New Sapients</h2>
        <p>If the early Ultimocene were to focus on the biodiversity of the world at large, <strong>the middle was to
                focus on the evolution of three new sapient cultures</strong>, each pushed to intelligence by a changing
            world, and which must cooperate to stay alive. A vibropteryx, descended from the species shown in the recent
            tribbat post, alongside an herbivorous antlear circuagodont and a bumblebadger (a quadrupedal viva) known as
            the <strong>gravedigger.</strong></p>
        <figure><img alt="" src="images/iu8x5nF.png"></figure>
        <p>The gravedigger, a highly intelligent but fiercely territorial bumblebadger, evolved first near the end of
            the early Ultimocene before the ice age. It evolved to construct pitfall traps, baiting them with spears to
            catch unwary circuagodonts which it then butchered and ate. Sapient but solitary, with an ingrained
            intolerance of their own species, they didn&#39;t develop any culture. Millions of years would pass before
            they did. Good at what they do, the gravediggers simply didn&#39;t need to change.<br />
            <figure><img alt="" src="images/8LrNsHw.png"></figure>
            <p>Until their prey got smart too. </p>
            <p>Pushed to sapience themselves from the gravedigger&#39;s increasingly complex trapping methods, an
                antlear species became a sophont itself.</p>
            <figure><img alt="" src="images/oFJ1A5O.png"></figure>
            <p>And they declared war on the gravediggers, driving them out of their forests.<strong>They won the
                    predator/prey arms race.</strong></p>
            <p>But only in time for the arrival of the ice age. Around them, summers grew shorter; winters harsher. And
                the trees they depended on to not grow as well. <strong>So the sapient antlears became skilled
                    gardeners. </strong>They selectively trimmed and later selectively bred their food trees to be
                smaller and hardier to endure the cold. They became ecosystem engineers, removing plants they did not
                eat to replace with those they did, yet without destroying the environment entirely<strong>. They
                    cultivated a food forest, ideal for their needs, while still harboring other species</strong>. As
                other, uncultivated forests suffered from climate change, their forests persisted. And so the sapient
                tribbat - a tiny pollinator - moved in as well. They came to rely on the sap that bled from the cut
                trees after the antlears fed in the cold periods when flowers were absent. For many generations, neither
                likely was aware of the intelligence of the other. <strong>Eventually, however, they formed some sort of
                    alliance with the tribbat pollinated and dispersing the food plants of the antlear as the climate
                    grew colder and insects which formerly did so more rare.</strong></p>
            <p>The tribbat would look much like its extant ancestor.</p>
            <figure><img alt="" src="images/blue_eared_vibropteryx_by_sheather888_ddtf3cl-fullview.jpg"></figure>
            <p>As time wore on, the gravediggers returned to the antlears&#39; forest in search of food. Normally they
                would be driven off, but as the climate got ever worse, eventually one population made a deal with the
                devil.<strong> They cooperated with their predators, for they needed them as labor; only the gravedigger
                    could move soil enough to build retaining walls they now needed to make microclimates to sustain
                    their trees through the cold, or to bury their food plants under the soil to keep them from freezing
                    to death over winter. </strong>The two species formed a truce; the gravediggers got to live in the
                forest, eating other animal species and the dead of the antlears, in return for becoming partners in
                gardening. And so, these three very different species formed a cooperative to sustain the last forest on
                Serina through a changing climate - the fruition of an idea postulated years ago by
                <strong>Cuttlefish.</strong></p>
            <figure><img alt="" src="images/D20Kc0K.jpg"></figure>
            <p>The exact timeline isn&#39;t certain, but eventually - despite their best efforts - climate change wins,
                and this society of ecology breaks down with the extinction of two of its components.<strong> Only the
                    gravedigger survives the end of forests</strong>, for it can survive on the tundra that remains
                after the last tree&#39;s extinction, eating smaller animals. During their thousands-of-years long
                cooperation with the antlear, the gravediggers adopted some of their culture and progressed as a race.
                When they died out, however, they reverted to their old ways. <strong>Able to overcome their differences
                    with their prey, but not to escape their hard-wired territorial instincts among their own kind, they
                    became solitary again. </strong>They survived another million years or so, in the process losing
                that spark of self-awareness and becoming just wild beasts once again, before the climate became too
                harsh for them to persist as well. This would be a tie in to the theme established earlier with the
                babbling jays, showing that sapience is not the end point of life; non-sapient species have much longer
                dynasties. Sapients, in my view, are rare, short-lived flukes of nature. <strong>And none will last very
                    long. </strong> </p>
            <h2>A New Age of Ants and the End of it All</h2>
            <p>One of my favorite ideas for Serina&#39;s later eras has not been drawn, and would be very difficult for
                me to draw anyway, were <strong>ant superorganisms</strong> that come to dominate Serina after its first
                major ice age, after the rise and fall of the new sapients, when few other animals, save some small
                birds and molodonts, have survived. Descended from the billions-stinger, these were conceptualized years
                ago as one of Serina&#39;s last new clades and would also be a hark back to the early days when empire
                ants ate all the birds and giant snails. With input from Hangin, we designed a pretty awesome clade of
                ants called <strong>shoggoths.</strong> </p>
            <p>The first shoggoths were aquatic; billions-stinger colonies that floated over water. From a floating
                raft-liked colony, formed from the bodies of worker ants, chains of linked ants would extend down into
                the water to hunt, puling prey back up into the colony - so the whole organism resembles a jellyfish. In
                order to make tentacles under the surface, they would have to go to shallow water where an ant can grip
                the bottom. Then more ants would form a chain as they move into deeper water. To stay under, the ants on
                the chain might use pebbles as weights, dropping them when prey was caught.</p>
            <p>After the first ice age wipes most of Serina clean, descendants of these ants returned to land, highly
                cohesive and having already evolved to function like a larger animal, carrying their queens and larvae
                in a nest of their own bodies and sending out chains of ants to catch and bring back prey - the chains
                functioning like arms. These later evolved new traits; they collected sticks, and collectively
                individual ants would link together to hold these supports, becoming like muscle fibers, and using the
                sticks like legs to walk on so that the colony developed the appearance of some sort of large centipede.
                As they became more coordinated, shoggoths turned toward hunting the last birds and molodonts which
                lived in burrows on the tundra - the last habitable land after the extinction of forests. New castes
                evolved, some with big eyes to see, and they would communicate with sounds to tell eachother what to do,
                with vocal cues acting like firing synapses in a brain to tell each consecutive ant linked in the line
                what to do on the instruction of the sighted caste. Able to separate into a horde of biting ants and
                infiltrate any crevice, no prey could hide from the shoggoths, which evolved further to use the bones of
                prey to build their own skeletons and the fur and feathers to insulate themselves; producing body heat
                from their collective movement, they were planned to become active, endothermic superorganisms.<strong>
                    Inescapable and amorphous, resembling shifting, clicking masses of insects and animal corpses, they
                    would be the most alien and frightening thing ever to evolve on the world.</strong></p>
            <p><strong>But they wouldn&#39;t be the final life form.</strong></p>
            <p>After the shoggoths ate almost everything else to death, they would themselves die out before the last,
                final ice age took hold. The very last bird would outlive them. It was planned to be a descendant of the
                <strong>bumblebird</strong>.</p>
            <figure><img alt="" src="images/N3e1QAA.png"></figure>
            <p><strong>An enormous, hundred-pound neotenic descendant</strong>, spending most of its life as a giant,
                blind killer worm in a desert - the final habitable place on the world after other extremophile life ate
                all the organic matter out of the tundra, leaving little more than sand. Living 300 million or more
                years hence, these giant predators existed like ant lions, living buried beneath sand pits and catching
                whatever came along; what exactly they ate is unknown. Molodonts might have still been alive, or else
                large insects or something else, which they killed with their wing-derived jaws as it fell onto them.
                For a few million years, such a species would persist in the last livable desert, but as food grew
                scarcer, they grew smaller. Serina would end with the poignant story of the final individual - a female
                centuries old. This species was intended to spawn male offspring parthenogetically; <strong>tiny,
                    short-lived beetle-like flyers that would historically disperse to mate with another giant sessile
                    female.</strong> So it was a bird with alternating generations. But by the time of the last bird,
                there were no more females and none had lived for over a hundred years. So every few decades, she
                spawned a few males that fly away and die, never finding a partner. Each summer grew shorter, until the
                final summer ends. The final post on Serina I decided on was to focus on how <strong>the giant worm bird
                    goes into hibernation for the last time, and spring simply doesn&#39;t come again.</strong></p>
            <p>The project wasn&#39;t intended to totally end even there; I long wanted to go back and fill out all the
                past epochs after the project had its official last chronological post. It is possible that now, that
                the timeline is at least broadly revealed, I could eventually do this. But don&#39;t get any hopes up -
                the reason I decided to share this was because I will probably never finish this project officially.
            </p>
            <p class="asterism">&#8258;</p>
            <p>With that, I have nothing more to share about Serina. It has been an enjoyable experience to design and
                share this world with everyone for so many years, and this post is closure both for me, if I never
                finish the setting, and hopefully for anyone who enjoyed the project. Just don&#39;t be sad that Serina
                is probably over. Be happy it happened.</p>
            <p>As I leave the community, I ask just one thing from anyone who loved Serina over the years. Take the
                torch from me, and go make something just as cool. </p>
