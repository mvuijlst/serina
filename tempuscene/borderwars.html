        <h1>Border Wars: Of the Bamboo and the Ant</h1>
        <p>Five million years is not a long time on a geologic time scale - it is, however, enough to have brought some
            significant innovations to Serina's ecology. Within this span have occurred numerous large evolutionary
            innovations not quite reached just five million years ago. Entire new forests now grow across Anciska and
            the north of Striata - no longer unnatural monocroppings, the sunflower barrens, these have instead given
            way to diverse forests of false trees composed in fact of large, perennial sunflowers which have since
            traded their annual growth habit to stand the year round on insulated above-ground trunks, providing a
            source of food and shelter to many animals the year round. </p>
        <p>Grasses begin to diversify noticeably in the Tempuscene as initial explosions of adaptable primitive plants
            die back and are replaced by, or themselves adapt into, forms adapted specifically to the conditions on
            Serina. Bamboo, pushed to rarer wet environments by a drying climate, still absolutely monopolize anywhere
            wet enough to support them, from pole to equator, thanks in part to an increasingly mutualistic relationship
            many species have begun to develop with a number of species of small leafcutter ants which evolve to live
            almost their entire lives based within the warmth and safety of their hollow stalks. Aided by the shelter
            that nests within the bamboo provided from cold, rain, and predators, the insects have begun in the
            Tempuscene to spread back northwards and south. Protected by nests inside these hard woody stalks, they can
            hibernate long winters away without much worry of being eaten by hungry birds. Initially existing as a
            parasite to the bamboo trees, they live within them as long as they can before they've eaten away too much
            of a cane's foliage for it to survive, and the cane dies - and takes with it the colony. By now however,
            some species have ceased to feed upon their own host plants or host species, allowing it to grow for longer
            and prolonging their own lifespans. In return, some bamboo begin now to evolve specially-designed hollow
            knots at their joints to accommodate the insects, which now serve to guard them from the onslaught of other
            ant colonies which try to feed on them. It becomes advantageous for bamboo clumps to attract and hold onto
            their own resident ant populations, for if claimed by one as home, it will not be eaten by another as
            supper. Many leaf-cutter ants evolve new warrior casts similar to those normally only seen in predatory
            ants, which serve only to guard host trees from the hungers of neighboring ant colonies while foragers,
            similar to the ancestral ants, go out to feed on their neighbor's home groves and braving their own
            warriors, unaware of the irony in the whole situation. It is the bamboo which are the true winners no matter
            what, however - all guarded by their own armies, they are individually all eaten considerably less
            frequently and in lesser quantity than otherwise they would be without the ant's border wars. Though the
            ants must consume the same amount of food no matter what, they no longer decimate single groves to death,
            instead taking only small and sustainable quantities from each plant.</p>
