        <h1>Myrmecophytes: The Logger Ant and the Monovitus Tree</h1>
        <p>25 million years PE, the mutualistic relationship that has developed between certain genera of leafcutter
            ants and several species of bamboo has produced a radiation of wildly successful new species that exist in
            symbiosis with one another.</p>
        <p>By the end of the Hypostecene, a distinct example of mutualism had already begun to spread across the world's
            forest ecosystems, where colonies of ants and bamboo plants had begun to adapt towards each others' benefit.
            The ants protected their host plant, known as a <b>myrmecophyte</b> (literally "ant-plant"), in return for a
            safe and secure place to call home, driving off other insects and keeping their home plant safe from
            threats. In the following ten million years this process has continued to an even greater extent. A new
            genus of ants has become obligatorily tied to a newly-evolved radiation of bamboo plants that no longer
            spread significantly by rhizomes into colonies, but instead grow single tall trunks which grow a radiation
            of secondary branches at every leaf node, eventually developing a pyramidal shape reminiscent of a pine tree
            with only a single leading shoot. This single tree lasts several years before flowering magnificently at its
            upper growing stem but a single time, producing seed, and then dying. These single-stemmed, tree-like
            bamboos grow more slowly than their clumping relatives and most other tree-like plants, which would normally
            put them at a distinct disadvantage in a high-competitive world, but these plants have a secret weapon: they
            grow large and extremely thick knots near its base and throughout its root system in which their symbiotes
            dwell.</p>
        <p>The knots are hollow, providing a perfect environment for the leaf-cutter ants to cultivate their fungal
            gardens, relatively safe from predators as well as the weather. No longer needing to dig their own burrows,
            they cultivate their gardens in pre-built beds, leaving them more time for other occupations, such as
            defending the host tree from all threats from tiny beetles to giant browsing birds. Any creature which
            attempts to feed on the host plant in which the ant lives is mobbed in mass and bitten with giant mandibles
            and stinging bites. Additionally, however, simple defense, already having been practiced by many species for
            several million years, has in a few new symbiotic relationships becomes active offense.</p>
        <p><a href="borderwars.html" rel="nofollow">As previously described</a>, leaf-cutter ants have existed in
            symbiosis with bamboo for more than ten million years by the middle Tempuscenic. Many species of ant still
            behave similarly to these ancestors, feeding on their neighbors and defending their hosts by attacking
            hungry herbivores - even other colonies of their own species on neighboring plants. There exist constant
            battles waged by the bamboo with their own insect armies that each exhibit specific castes adapted to either
            attack threatening animals or to clip vegetation. </p>
        <p>The <strong>Monovitus</strong> bamboo, however, does not grow where bamboos historically have. With its
            single trunk and slower than average growth rate, it has begun to adapt to a drier climate than most of its
            kind can tolerate. It moves onto the dry uplands where the sunflower trees thrive, storing energy in a
            strong taproot. The sunflowers are more abundant and grow faster than the bamboo and exude harmful tannins
            into the soil in attempt to stunt its growth and crowd out the competition - but the <em>Monovitus</em> has
            a solution. Its own leaves are thin, hard, and succulent, almost needle-like to survive in dryer
            environments, and with bitter alkaloids they are highly unpalatable to the particular genus of ants adapted
            to live within it. Even if several trees grow near each other, their ants do not battle. Instead of foraging
            from their own host species, the <strong>logger ants</strong>, with shearing mandibles for pruning plants,
            cooperate to search out more succulent foliage, and nothing is more succulent than the soft, broad leaves of
            the sunflower trees. As the secondary branches of the bamboo tree spread out in a whirl in all directions
            around the trunk, they regularly come into contact with surrounding sunflower trees that the ants then feed
            from, cropping the green leaves and taking them down to their burrows in the bamboo's roots to feed their
            fungus gardens. Unlike other bamboo, the sunflower trees have not adopted their own armies of protective
            ants and have no defense against such a systematic attack. All around the tree, the ants obliterate the
            surrounding vegetation, completely defoliating their host tree's competitors, cutting off their flowers
            before they bloom, and eventually killing them. Occasionally a brushfire burns away all of the food around
            the tree, sending the dry stalks of the sunflowers up in smoke, but the <em>Monovitus</em> survives by merit
            of its hard, dense wood. After a fire, its thin leaves are quick to regrow. In the intermediate period where
            its ant colony has nothing to forage, they turn to feeding on the nutrient-rich tissues of the host tree's
            root nodules, sufficiently nutritious to sustain them until their preferred food regrows around their host.
        </p>
        <p>Within approximately ten years, a colony has often cleared a circular space of more than ten meters around,
            or the approximate spread of its host's branches that now fill the empty space lushly and enjoy a bright
            spot in the sun. By this time, however, the squat, sprawling tree that now reaches perhaps five meters in
            height begins to stop growing. Its ant population having ground up all of its competition into a fine
            compost and deposited it at its own roots, it now sits on an enormous store of nutrients that it uses to
            produce a magnificent spike of flowers more than thirty feet above its branches, the blossoms cascading
            nearly twenty feet around from its topmost point in a splendid display. The show lasts for just three months
            before the flowers, pollinated by the wind, fade and large, hard seed pods take their place. Eventually the
            pods burst, revealing hundreds of thousands of fluffy, hair-covered seeds, each equipped with a white wisp
            of fiber that will carry it on the breeze. The seeds are hard, few birds favor them, and the majority float
            away on the wind. When the seeds mature and are shed, the bamboo dies, its life's work complete. Within a
            year its needles wither, its secondary branches drop to the soil, and eventually only a dry trunk remains
            like a monolith surrounded by vacant soil and short grasses. When the tree dies, the ant colony follows.
            Once their host's branches wither, they are isolated in a veritable desert. They consume the roots that once
            provided them shelter, but as the tree has since died, they have become dry, almost inedible, and when used
            up don't regenerate. Eventually, there will be nothing left to sustain the colony and it will collapse. Just
            before all is lost, the colony reproduces for the first time. For more than a decade it has produced
            workers. An extremely long-lived queen has laid hundreds of million of eggs in her lifetime, all of them
            infertile female workers. Now, tired and aged, she produces one last flush of eggs to be nourished by the
            last of the worker ants. Hormonal changes brought by the shortage of food result in a different crop of
            offspring this time - a swarm of flying queens and drones (fertile males and females). The winged ants take
            to the skies in search of a new home while their elders and their tired mother, without food, slowly go
            still and die beneath the roots of the great tree that sustained them for so long, their lives - but also
            their life's purpose - completed.</p>
        <p>The kings and queens are hard-wired to search for a new <em>Monovitus</em> tree in which to begin a new
            colony, but only a very young tree, just a few weeks old, will suffice. Any older and a tree will surely be
            claimed by an established colony. How possibly do the tiny ants, who have just days to find a new host
            before they starve, locate such a perfect tree?</p>
        <p>They use their noses. Not for the tree's specific scent, no - this would more than likely lead them to a
            mature tree already taken. They instead search out the scent of a recent brush-fire - charcoal and burned
            carbon. Fire is relatively rare in most Serinan environments, but in the dry forests it is a relatively
            common fact of life. Given the rapid growth rate of the sunflower trees, it is only when an entire forest
            has been cleared by wildfire that the seeds of the <em>Monovitus</em> tree stand a chance to establish
            themselves. Of countless thousands that floated all around from the now-deceased host tree, by chance one or
            two will surely have landed upon a patch of ground that would, before too long, be scarred by flame. Only
            when exposed to the extreme heat of a brushfire will the <em>Monovitus</em> tree's seeds germinate. Then,
            briefly free from competitors, the tree has several weeks to sprout and grow as fast as it can before the
            sunflower forest begins to sprout again around it. By the time it does, as much as two years after its
            parent tree flowered and began to die, it should be just around the time that the mother tree's colony will
            have produced its flush of new kings and queens in search of their own new little tree to call home. Dozens
            of the kings and queens released from the aged mother tree all hone in upon the new seedling bamboo tree,
            often the only one of its rare kind for miles around, fighting over squatting rights. Eventually only a
            single pair will take dominance in the first, smallest root node of their new host (but eventually, if
            another tree is nearby and the two come to grow together, multiple colonies will join together.) The little
            family will begin to breed, the flying male at first leaving the tree to distant greenery to bring back
            leaves to start a fungus garden before the other plants begin to return nearer to the colony. When the
            burned ground around the new tree begins to turn green with a new flush of vegetation, the male dies and the
            first flush of female worker ants - just a few of millions to come - take over foraging. As they prune away
            the little tree's competitors and fertilize its roots with compost, it grows steadily larger, sprouting
            additional hollow root nodules to support the new and growing ant colony. The cycle begins anew.</p>
