        <h1>Fishes of Sea and Shore: Swordwhales and Mudwickets - 25 Million Years PE </h1>
        <p>By the middle Tempuscenic, the live-bearing fishes
            have diversified enormously. From tiny colonists have radiated an enormous number of new lineages. Guppies
            give rise to dozens of distinct freshwater lineages, ranging from small minnow-like shoaling species to
            truck-sized riverine herbivores that may consume more than four hundred pounds of green food a day and give
            birth to as many as 100,000 free-swimming larval offspring in one litter. They give no parental care and
            even though they do not lay eggs, they still rely entirely on chance to reproduce and play the numbers game
            in hopes that one or two of their tiny infants will survive to maturity, for they contend with an onslaught
            of countless fierce new predators. From the platies and swordtails have arisen the
            <strong>swordwhales</strong>, lively shark-like carnivores with frightening, toothy maws that teem across
            all of the ocean's salt waters and supply their live young with a placenta-like tissue while in the womb,
            nourishing their embryos for prolonged periods in their bodies and giving birth to a much smaller number of
            large and extremely well-developed offspring. The swordwhale lineage has subsequently given rise to a number
            of veritably gigantic filter-feeders, some more than sixty feet in length and already vying as the largest
            bony fishes ever to exist. The livebearers have colonized the deepest ocean floor and the highest alpine
            stream, while the most enterprising among them have even begun to move towards the
            land.</p>
        <p class="asterism">&#8258;</p>
        <p>On warm, tropical mudflats, the bizarre <strong>Mudwickets</strong>, small
            but oddly-shaped creatures with squat toad-like bodies, bulbous eyes, huge mouths, and flattened bellies,
            hop from the tide and onto the shore to hunt seaside insects and crustaceans with needle-like teeth and
            over-sized crunching jaws. Distant relatives of the swordwhales, they crawl about on the sand with webbed
            hand-like pectoral fins and periodic thrusts of short tails, which function like a spring to catapult them
            to safety in times of danger, and survive above the water by absorbing atmospheric oxygen through a highly
            vascularized plate on the roof of the mouth and to a lesser extent though their skin in a manner akin to
            salamanders. So long as these structures remains moist, they allow the fish to survive indefinitely out of
            the water. Mudwickets are terrestrial from birth, able to breathe air from infancy, and will drown if
            trapped for a prolonged period in deep water; their gills diminished and their swim bladders vestigial, they
            can no longer swim. Instead of retreating to the water when danger threatens they rush to complex, communal
            burrows just below the high-tide line, which may extend five feet below the ground and consist of a series
            of flooded chambers. Every chamber in a burrow holds a large air pocket which can only be kept fresh and
            oxygenated through strenuous, repeated trips back and forth to the surface at every low tide, the fish
            bringing up a mouthful of depleted air and then back down a bubble of new, clean air with each descent to
            fill its reserves. These air pockets keep the fish alive when high tide returns and covers the burrow system
            in as much as four feet of water. The Mudwickets' burrows may be used by as many as two-hundred fish at any
            one time and can become quite complex. Different chambers are utilized for different purposes - the deepest
            chambers are for the storage of excess food, which lasts longest in relatively low-oxygen, cooler
            conditions, while the warmest, most oxygenated, shallow chambers near the surface are used as nurseries in
            which they give birth. The infants are large and well-developed when they leave the mother's body but remain
            underground for a considerable time before ever leaving to hunt on their own, being fed by the colony's
            adults. This appears to be an unintentional effort - the mudwicket having a tendency to drag its prey
            underground before feeding (to prevent it being stolen by a competitor or attracting a predator), thus
            allowing the young to gather around and gather the scraps, but it is effective nonetheless. </p>
        <p>The young mudwickets will remain underground while growing fat on their parent's scraps for as many as thirty
            days before they emerge from the burrow for the first time to hunt on their own and begin to pull their
            weight in maintaining the burrow. Individual colonies of mudwickets are male-dominated and these males,
            which are large and brightly ornamented, are fiercely territorial toward their same-sex neighbors, but as a
            colony grows a single male cannot possibility mate with as many females as he might control, giving males on
            the outskirts of the colony without harems of their own a chance to mate when the females come above ground
            to feed. Young males are driven from the colony at maturity, the lucky few to survive long enough to start a
            new burrow system beginning their own new harems and colonies, the rest surviving in only small shelter
            burrows and relying on sneak attacks to mate with other males' unguarded females to spread their genes. When
            a predatory bird threatens, every fish on the shore will vanish in an instant into the sand and seal the
            entrances of their burrows with a plug of mud until they are certain the threat has vanished. It is not
            unusual for a colony to remain entirely underground for an entire day after a fright, feeding on the
            invertebrates they have amassed in the lower chambers of their burrow system until they can be certain the
            danger has gone.</p>
        <p>Most of a mudwicket's diet consists of insects, hermit crabs, and other
            arthropods along with the occasional small fish trapped in a tidepool, though large species may occasionally
            ambush small birds. One genus specializes in bivalves, making regular forays down steep rocks into deep tide
            pools to pull them from submerged stones, then crushing the shells with enormous squared-off teeth to get at
            the meat. Conversely, another has evolved to forage quite far up the beach and away from the surf, having
            abandoned colonial existence for small and solitary burrows near the treeline at the end of the beach which
            just tap the underground water table. One particularly promising family of mudwicket has in fact left the
            seaside environment completely and moved far inland, following rivers and building its burrows in the muddy
            banks of freshwater ponds and streams. Here they prey on crayfish and aquatic insects as well as land
            invertebrates such as crickets and snails, that they may forage for as far as fifty meters from the water,
            crawling through damp leaf litter and even scaling small logs and fallen branches in the process. In rainy
            conditions, members of this group may travel over a mile inland to reach isolated sources of water, digging
            into damp soil or hiding under logs to keep damp in between open pools of water. Most solitary inland
            species are colored cryptically, but a small number are extremely vibrant and impossible to miss in shades
            of blue, red, and yellow, advertising deadly toxicity in the mucous of their skin that they engineer from
            their diets, which incorporate a significant amount of poisonous ants.</p>

            <figcaption> The seven-spotted mudwicket, <em>Ranacephalus septulocus</em>, is a plump, colonial species of
                mudwicket that thrives along the seashores and tidal estuaries of the Sierran Subcontinent <a
                    href="images/tempuscene.png" rel="nofollow">(See Map)</a>, where it dwells in large and complex
                burrow systems just below the high tide line. In most mudwickets males are larger and brighter than
                females, but females too in some species can carry some bright colors, and a female carrying a
                litter of offspring can become quite swollen in the days before pregnancy (pictured), rivaling the
                weight of her mate. Most species even at their extremes are hardly what could be considered large
                except on a relative scale, however; the seven-spotted mudwicket is an average 6.5 centimeters in
                length and just 1 - 2 ounces in weight. Though a descendant of the extravagant swordtail fish, their
                tails today, short and stocky, function for little more than an occasional boost of propulsion to
                dart down a burrow to safety.</figcaption>
