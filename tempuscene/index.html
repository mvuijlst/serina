            <figcaption> A biome map of Serina fifteen million years PE, showing tectonic changes since the Hypostecene,
                among them the separation of Anciska and Striata and the full fusion of Striata southwards with
                Wahlteria, which has nearly closed off a large inland ocean, as the supercontinent of Cirrus breaks into
                two distinct landmasses for the first time. Anciska itself also begins to pull apart, with its north
                moving eastwards and its south southwards towards Stehvlandea, widening a thin land bridge.

        <p>It is now fifteen million years since Serina's establishment, and the Hypostecene is over. In the last few
            million years, Serina has entered into a new climactic condition, with the moon gradually exhibiting
            <strong>a worldwide trend towards cooling and the spread of aridity</strong>. Within five million years of
            Serina's abandonment, once life had been allowed to establish itself firmly to its new ecology, initially
            mild and tropical conditions had already begun to dissolve, unsustainable without artificial maintenance.
            Instead, the world of Serina began to revert towards the drier grassland world its geography naturally would
            sustain best. With the gradual decrease in precipitation over much of the moon, bamboo forests which spread
            from pole to pole within only a few million years of establishment began to retreat to a smaller number of
            remaining, isolated regions still moist enough to support their rapid and lush growth, as hardier prairie
            grasses, sunflowers, and dandelion derivatives reclaimed much of their former range. Less reliant on high
            precipitation, these plants can store large quantities of water and nutrients in underground roots and
            tubers and guard it from hungry animals with spines and unpalatable tissues. Where rainfall is too low for
            bamboo to grow, but higher than on the open grasslands, <strong>sunflower barrens transform into the
                beginnings of a new sustainable woodland type</strong> as suddenly as other floral groups develop
            tolerance to the toxic tannins they produce and evolve to compete beside them. </p>
        <p>Beginning eleven million years PE, Serina entered the <strong>Tempuscenic Era</strong>. Characterized by a
            gradual shift of the Serinan world from tropical to temperate, it will bring Serina's first ice age as
            seasonal ecosystems will begin to outnumber tropical, the latter of which will soon be confined solely to a
            thin but rich ring along the equator, as the polar regions of Serina begins to experience snowfall for the
            first time. Only a taste of what is now to come, at the era's height Serina will develop its first
            permanently frozen polar ice caps, which will not melt again tens of millions of years. </p>
        <p>Serina will not become a snowball world, however, any more than our own world is today. Winter will still
            give way to spring, and spring to summer. A seasonal rotation on a tilted access means Serina experiences
            its seasons not unlike our own. There will always be balance, and life - now well established - will go on.
            Migration becomes widespread, as animals are forced away from comfortable home ranges with increasing
            changes in their environments as winter and summer grow increasingly different. Faced with these same
            challenges, Serina's flora begin their most noticeable evolution yet, beginning to take on appearances
            increasingly unlike their ancestors and to grow in new, innovative ways, carving their own path up the tree
            of life silently, often overshadowed - but not stopped - by the lively activities of the insects and animals
            around them. As desertification spreads, it is the towering tree-like <strong>sunflowers that slowly become
                Serina's equivalents to the cacti and other hardy succulents</strong> of Earth, reducing their foliage
            to only a seasonal flush, eventually for some to lose it all together in favor of swollen and spiny trunks
            with only their vibrant golden blossoms to ever belay their ancient ancestry as a common garden plant and
            roadside weed - but other plants will soon rise again to compete. Remaining equatorial and patchy temperate
            forest is still dominated by bamboo, which now lies overshadowed by more drought-tolerant flora in most of
            the rest of the rest of the world. In millennia to come, however, it will experience a resurgence, as the
            Tempuscenic and the changes it has brought will be the foundation - thanks to some little helpers - for
            <strong>the next major innovation in the plant kingdom</strong> which will put them one day again on par to
            - and perhaps even beyond - their hardier foresting counterparts. Conditions will no longer be universally
            paradisaical and pristine in a changing world, but change brings adaptation. Change is the only thing,
            anywhere, at any time, that always stays the same. As it always has, life goes on. <strong>And as it goes
                on, it becomes ever more distinct, unique, and diverse.</p>
