        <h1>Predatory Birds of the Tempuscene</h1>
        <p>The Tempuscenic era sees continued diversification of avian carnivores.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Falconaries</strong>, a clade of mostly flying predatory birds falling under the order
            <em>Falconara</em>,
            have speciated considerably since the Hypostecene and now number
            approximately 450 species spread worldwide, the smallest just an ounce
            in weight and the largest approximately the weight and stature of the
            extinct Haast's eagle. Physiologically they are extremely convergent to
            true falcons and kill prey, which can range from insects through
            aardgeese, with their hooked beaks and/or their curved talons. A
            sub-order, the <em>Ululava</em> - known as <strong>Bubirds</strong>,
            hunts by night with oversized eyes and particularly wide frog-like
            mouths, often swallowing their prey whole. Close relatives are the <strong>Shrike Finches</strong>,
            <em>Pugnaxornithes</em>,
            a cosmopolitan lineage of adaptable and predatory or omnivorous
            generalists similar to crows, rooks, and true shrikes that descends from
            the shriekers. Not as specialized as the true falconaries at active
            predation, they more readily pilfer nests, hunt insects, and consume
            carrion.</p>
        <p><strong>Tyrant serins</strong>, <em>Tyrannoserinae</em>,
            the descendants of the early predators known as skykes and before them
            the primitive axbills of the early Hypostecene, which were very similar
            to the ancestral aardgoose. Though distantly related as <em>Dromaeoserins</em>,
            tyrant serins have gone down a polar opposite evolutionary path and
            have become the largest terrestrial carnivores of the Tempuscenic era,
            with genera present in both the east and the west. They now reach sizes
            of up to nine-hundred pounds and thirteen feet in height and kill with
            their giant, sharply-hooked bill, which features a razor-sharp cutting
            "tooth" on either side to cut through bones and ligaments. Tyrant serins
            are social, hunting in pairs or large and coordinated packs to bring
            down the largest of ground birds, particularly the aardgeese. Their
            offspring are precocial, well-feathered in warm down and able to run at
            birth, but they cannot hunt for themselves for several months and rely
            on their parents' kills for the first year of their life. When six
            months old, they begin to shed their down and take on their adult
            feathers and join in active hunting and assist their parents, but they
            will then not develop adult coloration for more than a year or be
            self-sufficient until that time. Tyrant serins are either lifelong
            monogames or serial ones, picking new partners each season. In
            pack-hunting species, the pack usually consists of an alpha male and
            female and their offspring, plus young males brought in from other
            packs, with only the alpha pair reproducing and the other serins
            assisting in bringing up the young. Nesting is typical for ground birds,
            with incubation often done right out in the open in a basic scrape in
            the Earth, for the largest tyrant serins have no predators of their own.
            Tyrant serins engage in social singing, usually by night, which serves
            to affirm pack bonds and keep distant pack members in contact, similarly
            to the howls of wolves. Their songs remain complex and varied motifs,
            both genders engage in it, and no two individuals sing identically.
            Close relatives of the tyrant serins are the <em>Susopterinae,</em> the <strong>hogbirds</strong>.
            Less predatory than tyrant serins, they are similar to the common
            ancestor of both clades, the axbills, and comprise a diverse suborder of
            omnivores with large and sometimes ornamented bills equally suited to
            crushing seeds, fruit, and nuts as skulls, flesh, and bones. </p>
        <p><strong>Pelicanaries</strong>,
            <em>Pelicanarinae</em>,
            are a lineage of seabird descended from the duck-like dougals of the
            Hypostecenic. They are all almost completely aquatic and flightless,
            with large paddle-like wings and reduced webbed hind legs situated far
            back on the body. All species exhibit a pronounced pouch on the
            underside of the bill which is used to hold fish, but several especially
            large species of this lineage have also adopted a very unique trait:
            they incubate their own eggs within these pouches, with the male and
            female taking turns sitting at the surface to guard the egg. The pouch
            is well-vascularized with blood vessels and the relatively large egg,
            situated in the back near the throat, stays warm, dry, and oxygenated in
            this makeshift incubator while allowing the adults to completely avoid
            coming to shore to breed, where they risk numerous predators and
            competitors on crowded beaches. Pelicanarian mouth-brooding originates
            from a long process that began with grebe-like ancestors building crude
            nests in shallow bays out of floating vegetation. This situation
            provided an environment with fewer competitors and predators than on
            shore, but the egg was always at risk of falling into the water;
            subsequently, it became more buoyant, with a larger air pocket and a
            waxy eggshell cuticle less easily permeated by seawater. The adult birds
            simultaneously evolved to quickly grab and retrieve the egg in their
            throat pouch if it strayed from the nest in a wave. Eventually this gave
            rise to dorsal incubation, in which the nest was done away with
            entirely and the egg was incubated on the low, flat back of the adult,
            covered by the neck plumage and warm skin of the bare throat pouch to
            keep warm, a practice still used by many pelicanarians today. Eventually
            from there, true mouth brooding was achieved when the parents simply
            engulfed the egg in the pouch and kept it there at all times, safe from
            outside threats. As a result of their recently-cut ties to land and
            terrestrial incubation, mouth-brooding pelicanaries are extremely large
            seabirds that can no longer walk out of water, some weighing upwards of
            three thousand pounds and stretching twenty-five feet long, counting
            their necks which can in some species be almost half their total length.
            They are most often deep divers, pursuing open water fish and
            crustaceans, but shallow water specialists exist which feed on molluscs
            and invertebrates living in the shallow sediment of coastal waters. All
            species are monogamous, for their reproductive methods rely on
            cooperation, one partner watching the egg while the other feeds.</p>
