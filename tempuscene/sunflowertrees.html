        <h1>Sunflower Trees</h1>
        <p>By the Tempuscene, bamboo and sunflowers together make up the vast majority of tree-like plants, each forming
            the foundation of a major forest communities. Most generally bamboo thrive where conditions are wet and
            sunflowers are more tolerant of drier environments, though there is overlap. With a few notable exceptions
            most extant bamboo is primitive, forming enormous clumps that reproduce most effectively via spreading
            runners. Serinan Sunflowers by 25 million years PE, however, have changed dramatically and in often
            remarkable ways.</p>
        <p>Wherever rainfall is insufficient for the growth of bamboo thickets but more than is necessary for prairie
            grasses, a sunflower forest crops up. A far cry from the barren monoculture ecosystems of a very young
            Serina, the sunflower forest today is a unique, balanced ecosystem comprising many species and organisms and
            one that varies considerably across the world. All are defined, however, by the tall, broad-leaved flowering
            plants that form their canopies - gigantic, branching sunflowers that live for many years and build up their
            branching stalks with cellulose, eventually forming a woody trunk and reaching great heights. Sunflower
            trees are a polyphyletic grouping, descended from many distinct ancestors which have converged on a similar
            appearance in response to the same environmental condition; for example, tropical and temperate species are
            unrelated, as are most desert and rainforest species. Indeed at least four sunflower lineages independently
            developed a tree-like growth habit, surviving for a number of years without dying to the ground and building
            upon their old growth year after year, but superficially they are all very similar, with woody trunks that
            branch going upwards into many smaller growing shoots. The leaves are broad, flat, and generally nutritious
            to herbivores, either hairy, as in the ancestral sunflower, or smooth, depending on the species. All
            sunflower trees have shorter lifespans than most woody Earth trees, between ten and twenty years, but due to
            a rapid growth rate, this is fully sufficient to reach sizes of 60 feet tall or greater. Sunflower trees
            reproduce through seeds that follow often very bright and showy blossoms - sometimes still cheery and yellow
            and sometimes quite distinct from their ancestors - that are pollinated by beetles and honey ants or not too
            infrequently the wind, these trees having insignificant and colorless blossoms without noticeable petals.
        </p>
        <p> Just like the modern sunflower, the seeds of sunflower trees are extremely nutritious and desirable to
            birds. In temperate climates, the survival of young birds in their first winter can be completely reliant on
            the success of the seed crop that year. If the trees don't produce large crops in the autumn, the young are
            unable to fatten up sufficiently to survive migration and starve. Flocks of millions and not infrequently
            billions of seed-eating songbirds gather when crops are heavy, gathering on the bristly branches so thickly
            that they hang limply under their combined weight. In the tropics, sunflower trees are equivalent to Earth's
            figs - there is almost always one fruiting somewhere, always providing a reliable food source to jungle
            animals no matter the time of year. Since sunflower trees grow rapidly, they are among the first plants to
            colonize cleared ground after a fire, but individual trees are extremely susceptible to flames and burn up
            rapidly, their sap highly flammable and their lightweight, corky wood extremely combustible. A lengthy
            wildfire can completely destroy vast tracts of sunflower forest, burning hot enough to completely break down
            the trees' trunks to ash and cinders and leaving little more than a field of charcoal in their wake, and is
            often fueled by the dried leaves, fallen flowers, and dead branches that tend to accumulate under the forest
            in the dry environments in which they thrive. In just a few months, however, a completely charred forest
            which seems hopelessly destroyed will return to a bright green garden as the trees return in the form of
            sucker shoots sent up by the tree's roots and seeds buried in the soil. Forests tend to burn down completely
            at least every other decade and regenerate, meaning few ever truly reach their potential natural lifespans
            or sizes, but incredible growth rates and maturity offset this. A sunflower tree can easily grow fifteen
            feet tall and then flower abundantly in its first year - a benefit of evolving from an annually-growing
            roadside wildflower - meaning that even the shortest season is usually enough to complete a generation.
            Wherever a sunflower tree does manage to grow to its full fifty or sixty foot height, however, it is truly a
            sight to behold. A single tree may arch over with ten thousand blossoms, attracting millions of pollinators
            in the brief two to three weeks before it loses its petals and becomes an unexceptional green tree once
            again for the remainder of the year. Aardgeese browse the nutritious green shoots and leaves extensively.
        </p>
        <p>The understory of the sunflower forest is usually a patchwork of smaller shrubs, clover, short fern-like
            grasses that spread along the shady soil, and periodic clearings where wildflowers grow in dense carpets out
            from the leaf litter. Among the most successful forest shrubs are the long-lived, thorny derivatives of
            dandelions that grow several meters above the ground on raised woody stems. They thrive in the shade, but
            their flowers worship the sun. They periodically send up giant, antennae-like flower stalks through the
            canopy and into the open air as much as five meters above, where ants can reach them to pollinate and where
            the seeds can then be taken by the wind and dispersed into distant forest clearings. Though they sprout only
            where the ground is clear and the sun unobstructed, they do not die out when the trees return and close the
            canopy like many other pioneer species. Instead they just slow down a bit, growing over many decades in the
            shade, seeing many sunflower trees come and go in their time. When the forest goes up in flame they die to
            the ground and regrow quickly from their roots, being all but invincible to most natural phenomena the
            forest can throw at them. </p>
        <p>Dandelion bushes are also highly successful desert plants, often forming dense stands on the dry borders
            between savannah and scrub, but it is the sunflowers which are are the dominant tree-like plant in Serina's
            deserts. Here, multiple genera have come to resemble not trees but cacti, having convergently evolved
            fleshy, barrel-shaped trunks to store water, reduced or fully absent leaves, and sharp protective thorns and
            hairs on their soft tissues to protect against evaporation and the hungering of herbivores. Desert sunflower
            trees are longer lived than forest species, and some may live for half a century or longer, for fire is
            infrequent in the true desert - there is rarely enough fuel. Like true cacti, these desert sunflowers
            produce beautiful and extravagant blossoms during the rainy season, blossoms which produce large quantities
            of nectar and attract both insects and pollinating birds. However, as the minimal resources of the desert do
            not allow for a massive overproduction of seeds to counteract the great number eaten by wildlife, these
            sunflowers have evolved a different strategy to spread their seeds. Instead of producing great quantities of
            large, bare seeds desirable to animals as a food source, they produce smaller numbers of smaller seeds with
            extremely hard shells encased in sweet, fleshy berries. Birds consume the fruits whole, rather than
            concentrating on the seeds, and pass the seeds intact in their droppings, dispersing them and helping the
            plant to reproduce</p>
