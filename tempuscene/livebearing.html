        <h1>Rise of the (nearly) Live-bearing Bird - 25 Million Years PE </h1>
        <p>As the <strong>Tempuscenic Era</strong> progresses, Serina continues to cool. By 25 million years
            post-establishment, the moon's polar regions have developed the first of their permanent ice caps and tundra
            has spread across the poles. The planet is largely a savannah world, with widespread grasslands covering the
            middles of every major landmass. Dense bamboo forest thrives on wet coasts and on the rainy sides of
            mountains and in isolated pockets worldwide while sunflower forests radiate widely across all of the world's
            continents. Serinan ecosystems throughout the Tempuscenic are well-established and diverse; the canaries
            have diversified into more than 20,000 distinct species, covering virtually the whole range of Earthly avian
            morphology and countless forms like the Earth has never before seen. From the smallest seed-eater to the
            largest terrestrial predator, thriving in the driest deserts, the coldest tundras, the wettest of jungles
            and even thousands of miles out at sea, the canaries continue to rule their new home world.</p>
        <h2>Aardgeese</h2>
        <p>One of the most competitive orders to evolve upon Serina so far, which have radiated enormously by the middle
            Tempuescenic, are the <strong>Aardgeese</strong>, <em>Aardanserinae</em>, now comprising a distinct suborder
            within the <em>Dromaeoserina</em>. Originating from a lineage of flightless, running herbivores, they are
            mainly a group of large, herbivorous to omnivorous canaries which still retain vestigial barbed wings
            despite many generations out of the air, with proportionately long legs and necks, and large stomachs able
            to ferment plant matter efficiently. They all exhibit large cropping bills equipped with tiny serrations for
            trimming grass and tough browse and rough and flexible tongues which can be scraped against the roof of the
            bill to crudely break up mouthfuls of coarse vegetation before swallowing it, improving their digestion and
            making them the first birds to have evolved, in some respect, to chew their food. They are running animals,
            adapted for long-distance travel, often at high speed. Aardgeese have especially well-developed <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synsacrum" rel="nofollow">synsacrum </a>bones and an elongated
            pygostle that together provide support to an elongated portion of the body set behind the legs, providing
            extra room to accommodate this large gut and subsequently shifting their center of gravity and altering the
            posture of their legs to compensate - particularly their thighs - which are more vertical than in other
            birds. Uniquely among birds, many aardgeese can stand close to fully-erect, like human beings, with the
            knees highly flexed and stretched completely downwards. </p>
        <p>With some primitive exceptions, Aardgeese exhibit a unique variation of plumage; with the exception of the
            wings and the rump, the development of advanced adult feathering no longer occurs in most members of the
            lineage and instead the animals retain only their soft, single-stranded down feathers as adults. This
            plumage is unbarbed and likely very similar to the inferred appearance of the most primitive feathers. As it
            occurs on the aardgoose it is extremely dense, each feather follicle almost directly adjacent to another,
            and no longer grows from tracts in the skin but sporadically across the skin, like hair but in clumps of
            three fibers each attached at the base. Each three-tufted feather is extremely thin and grows rapidly - if
            plucked, it can completely regenerate within a single day. The feathers in the body plumage are individually
            so small that they use extremely little blood when developing, meaning that they do not cause heavy bleeding
            if damaged while immature as large barbed feathers may. Aardgoose plumage is short, soft, and downy,
            generally just an inch or two thick on the trunk of the body, but extremely dense and insulating and fits
            more tightly to the body than is expected in a bird, closely following the curvature of the body similarly
            to fur rather than masking it in thick feathers. Where adult feathering still emerges on the aardgoose's
            body - the rump and the wings and occasionally the crown of the head - it does so from almost vestigial
            feather tracts and rises through the thick downy "fur" that covers the bird's body. The neotenic loss of
            most adult plumage in most aardgeese seems to have occurred in the common ancestor of most living Aardgeese
            within 10 million years PE. A scarce number of extremely basal surviving representatives of the clade which
            split before this time still develop adult plumage over their bodies. </p>
        <p>Aardgeese by this time occur on every major continent, with a total diversity topping more than 450 species.
            Aardgeese have come to all but completely stake claim on megafaunal grazing and browsing niches as a result
            of their efficient grazing adaptations, precocial offspring which can run almost from birth, and cursorial
            nature that allowed their earliest representatives to escape early predators as the <strong>Skykes</strong>,
            <em>Tyrannoserinae</em>, that have since hunted such less adaptable animals as the enormous, defenseless
            <strong>womblers</strong> to complete extinction. The smallest Aardgeese of the Tempuscenic are not much
            larger than a rooster while the largest representatives may stand more than twelve feet tall at the head and
            weigh very near to one thousand pounds, making them among the most diverse in size of all canaries of their
            time. </p>
        <h2>The Ovovivavians: The (Nearly) Live-bearing Bird</h2>
        <p>The most successful new branch of Aardgeese 25 million years PE is the <em>Ovovivavia</em>, a suborder
            endemic to the eastern landmass of the moon, from Striata through Wahlteria and down as far as Karii and the
            southern pole (<a href="images/tempuscene.png">see world map for reference</a>), but in particular the
            temperate seasonal environments. The many varied members of this clade have all evolved towards the shortest
            external incubation period of any bird and surely the shortest that is physically possible - most eggs hatch
            within minutes of being laid by the female! This remarkable fact, almost unbelievable at first, comes as a
            direct result of the Ovovivavanians having developed the most advanced reproductive process so far evolved
            in known archosaurs. Instead of laying clutches of multiple eggs and then incubating them for a prolonged
            period on the ground where countless predators are always eager to snatch a meal, Ovovivavians produce only
            one single egg which is retained in the oviduct until it is ready to be laid, effectively being the only
            birds which truly become pregnant. This manner of reproduction allows an egg which would be too large for
            the mother to incubate properly outside her body, and subsequently aardgoose eggs are truly enormous. In the
            smallest species, they may weigh as much as one-sixth that of the mother, and while proportionately smaller
            in larger species, a 200 pound aardgoose can easily produce a 17 pound egg and that of a truly giant species
            may weigh as much as 30 pounds, nearly a third again larger than an elephant birds' egg, the largest known
            on Earth. The egg develops in a uterus-like swelling in the reproductive tract toward the hind end of the
            animal, behind its legs and pressing near to the stomach, making full use of the elongated body unique to
            the aardgoose family, which provides not only room for the over-sized stomach but also the enormous egg as
            it incubates. </p>
        <h3>Pseudo-ovoviviparity: How does it work?</h3>
        <p>The term "ovovivavian" is a slight misnomer; these aardgeese are not truly live-bearing, for their eggs hatch
            externally. However, they are likely as close as a fundamentally modern bird can conceivably evolve towards
            true ovoviviparity. In most species the entire incubation is done internally.</p>
        <p>While other birds produce many eggs, laying one at a time until a whole clutch is complete, the mother
            aardgeese of this clade stop at a single egg and retain it in their body for a prolonged amount of time. The
            egg takes up almost the entire oviduct, which prohibits clutches of more than this single embryo in a
            season, and in the event two eggs are fertilized, the second is given priority and the first voided, laid
            and abandoned. The successor egg, however, may then remain in the mother's body for more than 50 days before
            itself being laid - in the very largest of aardgeese as long as 75 days - and is incubated through its most
            tender days internally at the perfect temperature for its development - the perfect natural body temperature
            of its species. Among other benefits, this permits the mother to reproduce much earlier in the season in
            temperate climates than other birds and gives her a strong competitive edge in cold regions where eggs
            incubated on the ground would freeze. Protected inside her body by its relatively large size and subsequent
            durability compared to a smaller egg, it is cradled by the mother's abdomen throughout its entire
            incubation. The muscles of the mother's reproductive tract exert upon the egg at all times a gentle, even
            level of pressure that prevents any one weak spot of the eggshell from succumbing to stress and cracking as
            the mother goes about her business, but this works only because the aardgooses' egg is so immense. Much
            smaller and the shell would be too weak to withstand the pressures it would find itself in as the mother
            runs and moves - the aardgoose's reproductive strategy is extremely ingenious but limited: it is truly only
            possible in a relatively large and flightless bird, or perhaps one extremely sedentary while carrying her
            egg. However, this would defeat the purpose of the adaptation, which is to free the mother from having to
            sit and expose herself and her young while incubating.</p>
        <p>The egg receives the regular gas exchange it requires in the reproductive canal through the periodic
            reflexive contraction and expansion of the abdominal muscles as they press against the egg with each of the
            mother's breaths, keeping it stable and additionally ventilating the pseudo-womb with each contraction. Each
            inhalation of the mother causes the muscles to momentarily pull away from the egg, allowing it to rotate
            slightly to keep the embryo from sticking to one side of the eggshell, and pulling in a pulse of fresh air
            through the cloaca which is quickly warmed inside the relatively hot interior of the mother's body. In
            effect her reproductive tract becomes a second lung of sorts during her pregnancy, not for herself, but for
            her offspring.</p>
        <h3>Hatching The Young</h3>
        <p>The mother Aardgoose relies on auditory cues from her unborn offspring to determine when is the best time to
            lay the enormous egg, neither so soon that it will require further incubation out of the body (which the
            mother has usually lost any instinct to do) or so late that it might rupture internally and fills her body
            with lacerating chunks of eggshell, infecting and likely killing her. Between forty-five and seventy-five
            days after the egg is formed in the reproductive tract, longer in larger species and less in the smaller,
            the embryo inside begins to chirp. At first the calling is faint, but it grows stronger by the day until it
            is almost constant, nearly frantic. When the embryo within the egg is nearing hatching, typically three to
            five days after peeping begins, the sound is significantly loud that that the mother can hear it within her
            own body cavity. The calls of her offspring initiate a rapid flood of her maternal hormones, which serve not
            only to alter her behavior in a motherly way but to relax the muscles in her reproductive tract and release
            the egg. From here she knows instinctively that she has a job to do - the aardgoose's eggshell, in its
            evolutionary process, has become so thick, in order to stay intact inside the mother's body, that the infant
            usually cannot hatch without the assistance of its mother carefully pipping the egg to assist it. The hen
            excitedly nestles over the egg, surrounding it in the long, soft plumage of her degraded wings, and gingerly
            cracks the air pocket in the top of it to free her baby. She works diligently but with extreme care to break
            the eggshell and let the infant out into the world, pulling the shell apart with her flexible tongue and
            strong bill until the chick is loose and finally able to see the mother it has called for so long. </p>
        <p>A new mother sits tightly over her new baby, keeping it warm and sheltered and grooming its plumage dry in a
            distinctly un-bird-like manner - more like a mammal would be expected to do - before giving it its first
            meal - a frothy, highly nutritious crop secretion similar in consistency to cow's milk. Unlike its
            ancestors, it will have all but used up its egg yolk in the days before hatching. As the infant does not
            have to exert itself in this process, however, like most birds do, it finds energy and begins to stand and
            walk around extremely quickly, often within an hour. At birth the chick is extremely well-developed, large
            and alert, and can run and follow its mother and its herd that same day, unlike the highly dependent and
            vulnerable young of earlier ancestors. The mother aardgoose is an exceptionally devoted parent to her young
            and to other's young; living in herds, mothers will readily tend to any young which beg for food, not only
            their own, and all serve to protect each other's chicks from danger, though it doesn't seem this is because
            they confuse their young with those of other females, for specific mother-offspring bonds are very strong
            and mothers will strongly favor their own offspring when resources are limited. Rather, it simply seems to
            be an instinct to protect all of the young around when conditions are sufficient for everyone - as long as
            resources allow, when everyone chips in success is improved for all. A young Aardgoose is fed on richly
            nutritive crop milk for a number of months after its birth before fully weaning around one year of age, but
            it begins to feed itself a little by two months of age. It is completely independent by its first birthday.
        </p>
        <p>If the offspring dies in its shell, or if it was infertile to begin with, a female aardgoose will eventually
            void the egg within two weeks of the anticipated incubation time, knowing instinctively that it has proven
            inviable. Without chirping from within, she will ignore the egg as she would an accidental second offspring
            at the beginning of her breeding cycle, leaving it for the scavengers. In such an event, the hen has wasted
            time carrying the lifeless egg, but has not expended significant resources in doing so beyond those used to
            produce the egg in the first place itself over a month ago, and can become impregnated again immediately,
            hopefully more successfully. Infertile pregnancies are relatively common in first-time mothers and become
            less so with maturity. </p>
        <h3>Evolution</h3>
        <p>The first Ovovivavian is thought to have evolved roughly eight million years ago, from an ancestor which
            gradually delayed laying further and further along in order to protect the offspring from predators and get
            an edge on competition in cold climates. Originally external incubation would be delayed only for a few days
            and then would commence normally, but through the process of natural selection those individuals which
            proved able to do so for longer and longer periods and adapted ways to make the process work more
            efficiently found greater success than their competitors. These adaptations include not only the gradual
            thickening of the eggshell to resist internal breakage and the subsequently necessary instinct to assist in
            hatching their own offspring but the advanced state of the muscles within the birds' body itself, which have
            become sufficiently mobile to manipulate the egg internally and cradle it without either losing it and
            laying it prematurely or getting it stuck in place, seemingly in response to the habit of the female
            intentionally delaying laying for short periods of time when conditions may not have been favorable. Other
            aardgeese can occasionally do this already, even postponing the development of further eggs in the clutch to
            avoid a waste of energy if conditions are not safe to lay eggs, suggesting it's probable that the original
            evolution of the modern condition originated in this way. Gradually, it became the norm to abort all but the
            first egg in a clutch and to retain it for a very long time before laying it, the muscles in the oviduct
            becoming stronger and better able to support it safely. The instinctive pushing reflex of a female bird with
            an egg in the oviduct remained, now becoming the driving force for the oxygenation of the oviduct to allow
            the egg to breathe. The process would quickly void the egg were it not for the support of additional muscles
            further towards the cloaca which constrict the tract to keep the egg in place. These muscles contract just
            tight enough to keep the egg from sliding too far southwards and leaving the body during incubation, letting
            the egg finally slide past only the mother voluntarily relaxes them when the egg is ready to hatch. Once the
            cloacal muscles retract, the "breathing" movements quickly become pushing movements and release the egg from
            the oviduct and into the world in the usual manner.</p>
        <h3>Social Behavior and the Benefits of Pseudo-Ovoviviparity</h3>
        <p>Ovovivavian aardgeese are interestingly not monogamous like most of their near relatives - instead, single
            males guard harems of females and fight aggressively between themselves for mating rights. The males are
            much larger than the females and highly ornamented with bold coloration and bill casques while females are
            plain. More basal <em>Cursoserinans</em> notably are still monogamous but are also gender dimorphic. In
            these species, males use their brawn to defend and care for their smaller, camouflaged partners whilst they
            incubate their clutches of eggs. The male in these species does not sit on the eggs, but feeds the female
            while she does, allowing her to remain on them for the entire long incubation period, and he drives off
            predators that threaten her in her vulnerable position. When the chicks hatch, the male and female both feed
            the young crop milk. Both aardgoose clades have precocial offspring, but the Ovovivanian chick is larger and
            stronger at birth as it does not have to fight a race against time to develop and hatch in the dangerous
            world outside its mother's body. The Ovovivavian aardgoose hatches only a single chick at once while others
            may rear as many as six, but its young is born larger and cared for for longer. While the basal aardgoose
            will likely lose as many as half of its young before they are mature, the single chick has a higher rate of
            survival as a result of the extra safety net its mother's derived reproductive behavior. The basal aardgoose
            must also wait to nest until the climate is right, putting her at a disadvantage in those not-too-uncommon
            springs when the weather takes a long time to warm. Able to start as much as a month earlier, the
            Ovovivavian female can be onto her second "eggnancy" by the time her competitor has laid her first clutch.
            She can continually become pregnant and hatch offspring as long as the weather allows, readily producing
            three clutches in a good summer. By autumn she may lead three chicks of different ages all at once which
            will all remain with her until the following spring when they are all independent and the weather is mild.
            By then, food is abundant again for the youngsters as they set out on their own in the herd. Siblings will
            remain together for most of their second season, the oldest often taking over partial mothering duties for
            the youngest. The younger siblings may still occasionally be fed small feedings of crop milk by their older
            brothers and sisters until they are close to one year old. At this time, as they reach their own
            adolescence, their older siblings their siblings have reached full sexual maturity and move on to start
            their own families, already having had some advance practice in childcare. The youngest birds, born late in
            their first year, will not reproduce their second season but will wait until the following spring when they
            are approaching three years of age.</p>
        <p>With a diversity broadly equivalent to all of Earth's ungulates and filling an equivalent series of niches,
            adaptable bodyplans and revolutionary evolutionary advancements, Aardgeese by the middle Tempuscenic already
            hold excellent prospects in the coming millennia upon the true world of the birds.</p>

                <p><em>The White-browed Viva, </em>Cervanser cervanser<em>, is a mid-sized, browsing representative of
                        the Ovovivavian clade. The most widespread member of the </em>Cervanser<em> genus - the
                        "deer-goose" group - it is native to the open woodlands and tall grass prairies across most of
                        Striata in the middle Tempuscenic era, 25 million years PE. Aardgeese of these genus, which
                        comprises about twenty species, are mostly specialized as browsers. They are less sexually
                        dimorphic than some other genera, particularly those which live on the open plains, and the
                        males of this genus are most often only slightly larger and more colored than their female
                        counterparts. Vivas, like some other Ovovivavians, exhibit large, keratin-covered bone spurs on
                        their wrists. These are used by the hen in defense and the male in intra-specific combat. These
                        are not to be confused with true claws, which all Serinan birds, as passerines, ancestrally
                        lost.</p>
                <p>Pictured is a day-old chick alongside an expectant mother and adult male. The swollen oviduct of the
                    hen is clearly visible through her feathers as she carries her 15 pound egg. As an Ovovivavian
                    aardgoose can carry only a single offspring per breeding cycle, the infant present in this group
                    must belong to a different mother, either not visible outside the shot or perhaps deceased, the
                    chick subsequently adopted by the expectant mother as her maternal instincts kick in strongly in the
                    days before her own young is born. Vivas live in smaller herds than savannah aardgeese, rarely more
                    than six or seven females to a single dominant male.</p>
