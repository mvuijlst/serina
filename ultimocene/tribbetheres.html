        <h1>Overview of Tribbetheres of the Early Ultimocene</h1>
        <p><strong>Serina </strong>may have begun as <i>the world of birds</i>, but the past few tens of millions of
            years have seen an explosive success of some of its additional and once purely accessory animal groups.
            Modest animals introduced at first purely to stabilize an ecosystem for the survival of canaries
            <strong>have achieved their own greatness over the eons</strong>, rising to meet the birds on a level
            playing field in the game of life - and perhaps none of these secondary colonists has achieved more than the
            <strong>guppies</strong>. Far from the timid pond-dwelling prey of Serina's dawn, they have given rise to
            countless new clades in and out of the water. Yet one in particular stands out in the early Ultimocene for
            the sheer variety of form and function it has attained.; <strong>now nearly so far derived from their
                aquatic ancestry as the first canaries</strong>, here can now be found a brilliant, fully endemic
            assemblage of creatures unlike any before them. <strong>255 million years PE,</strong> during Serina's
            <strong>golden age of biodiversity</strong>, the little blue moon has firmly become the world <strong>not
                only</strong> of birds, but that of the terrestrial toothed-carps; the tripedal teleosts; AKA, the
            <strong>tribbets.</strong></p>
        <p>The ancestors of tribbets, the <strong>mudwicket fishes</strong>, first emerged from the water onto the sandy
            shore a staggering 230 million years ago, when Serina was a young world and few other modern clades had
            evolved at all. The first still bipedal <strong>vivas</strong> were just beginning their first evolutionary
            forays into live-birth; the <strong>softbilled tentacle birds</strong> would not evolve their namesake
            facial appendages for almost 50 million years; and the <strong>metamorphic birds</strong> were still far off
            in an uncertain future, their ancestors at the time still nondescript perching birds that flitted through
            the background art of more notable species. The forays of these earliest tribbet ancestors were brief. Their
            movements, powered by sideways flicks of their tails and heaving motions of their pectoral fins, were clumsy
            at best. Yet in a world lacking in reptiles or amphibians, and their subsequent niches often unfulfilled,
            they found much to be gained in colonizing the land. Food and safety from waterborne predators were
            significant pressures toward improved terrestrial adaptations, and the first true tribbets were firmly
            established on Serina by 75 million years PE. They now had watertight skin and could breathe atmospheric
            oxygen exclusively with a set of lungs derived from the uppermost pocket of the stomach. The pectoral fins
            developed steadily stronger bases, eventually coming to form a proxy of the tetrapod forearm, with the fin
            rays becoming digits at the end of a wrist, while the tail formed a sturdy third leg, though early tribbets
            experimented considerably with different tail postures and weight-bearing designs. With fins and tails
            repurposed as walking limbs, some tribbets come to resemble reptiles and to fill similar roles in their
            ecosystems. More than one hundred million years later forms such as these earliest still persist, though in
            less abundance than in past eons, as ectotherms that rely on the sun's rays for warmth, with sprawling
            posture.</p>
        <p>But the three-legged form was sturdy and successful, so much so that other lineages evolved over time toward
            more active habits. By 150 million years PE a new family of tribbet we knew as the <strong>hoppers</strong>
            was evolving, more energetic with the ability to regulate their own body temperatures independently of their
            environment and tied closely to increased care of their young after birth. To maintain the warmth they
            generated with their metabolism they developed a thin hair-like integument keratin from their scales, which
            narrowed and thinned into a heat-retaining pelt - sparse and fuzzy at first, becoming dense and furry over
            time. <strong>Around the same time they adopted a fully upright posture made possible by a 90 degree
                rotation of their tail-leg</strong>, naturally oriented to flex side to side, so that it could be pulled
            fully beneath the body and bent in the back and forth axis. At the very end of the Thermocene some 170
            million years PE, just before the world was racked by its worst mass extinction to date, the tribbethere
            clade rose and became one of just a small handful of successful disaster taxa. The first tribbetheres were
            nimble, fast-moving carnivores that bounded on three legs - small but fierce - and preyed upon birds, eggs
            and anything else they could engulf in their expansive toothy jaws. <strong>Their gill arches had evolved by
                now into remarkably mobile ear pinnae that focused their hearing</strong> and, along with their hair
            coats and the form of their limbs, subsequently gave them a mammal-like outward appearance - as long as the
            jaws were closed. When opened their jaws extended forward and out, revealing disproportionately sharp and
            deadly teeth that could reach out and pluck prey. <strong>Indeed, it would become these specialized,
                extensible jaws </strong>- inherited as they were from their earliest aquatic ancestors, the
            live-bearing fishes that used them to catch their own tiny prey - <strong>that would now become the pivotal
                trait in their evolution. </strong>By the Ultimocene the tribbetheres had evolved into athletic pursuit
            predators (<strong>canitheres</strong>), secondarily aquatic fish-eaters (<strong>mertribs</strong>),
            seed-cracking specialists (<strong>molodonts</strong>), gracile grazers (<strong>circuagodonts</strong>),
            and even powered flyers (<strong>tribbats</strong>), all of which compete effectively and are perhaps at
            times even more competitive than birds - and every one of these clades owed at least a degree of their
            success to their specialized jaws. <strong>With mouths that stretch and shear, reach and retract, smash and
                saw, the tribbetheres exploit the resources of their world in ways no bird ever could</strong> - and at
            times push the birds to the margins of what was once a refuge all their own. The relative abundance of
            niches that Serina's land offered in earlier eras allowed explosive adaptation and gave rise to numerous
            unique and endemic clades that would have been impossible with mammal competitors on Earth. But today, with
            tribbetheres as a new and highly competitive counterpart, ancient dynamics have returned. Birds now share a
            world ever-evolving, <strong>as life and its interactions becomes ever more complex in the climax of our
                world's history.</strong> And not all birds will survive the <strong>age of tribbetheres</strong>, an
            ongoing ecological turnover unfolding as we speak.</p>
        <p>The diversity of early Ultimocene tribbetheres (and some close relatives) will be presented through several
            chapters. As a precursor to familiarize the reader with the relationships therein,<strong> the positions of
                notable tribbethere clades on their evolutionary tree can be observed in the cladogram below. </strong>
