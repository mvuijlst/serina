        <h1>Molodonts of the Early Ultimocene: Part 1</h1>
        <p>Sometimes in natural selection a single trait can lead seemingly insignificant life forms to incredible
            success. Such an adaptation, evolved first for one specific purpose, can sometimes be repurposed in a myriad
            of ways - the feathers of dinosaurs that went on to become birds for example. <strong>Such is also the case
                with what are now the most morphologically varied and specious grouping of all tribbets</strong>, the
            <strong>molodonts</strong>, who owe all of their success to an extraordinarily specialized set of teeth.</p>
        <p>All tribbetheres are allied by their remarkable jaws, which come in many variations. The most basal is
            a simple extensible mouth similar to still-aquatic teleost fishes and still present in the tribbats and
            canitheres. The molodont clade though, which diverged around 50 million years ago, shortly after the
            Thermocene-Pangeacene boundary, <strong>has sacrificed this length for increased jaw strength</strong>.
            These tribbetheres <strong>evolved robust muscles that wrapped around the top of their snouts and
                powered a crushing top-down bite force to crack open hard seeds,</strong> becoming living
            nutcrackers. Over time most of the teeth in their upper jaw fused into what was effectively a singular
            massive tooth, forming a singular pestle-like grinding surface against a similar tooth plate that
            extended forward from the lower jaw like a mortar. By extending the upper jaw slightly, the molodonts
            were able to slide their upper grinding tooth against the sturdy lower one, not only opening seeds but
            pulverizing them to a paste, shells and all, and consuming the entire thing. This is the ancestral
            molodont state - a general sort of tribbetherian rodent - and one which remains widely successful in the
            early Ultimocene. </p>

            <figcaption>This diagram shows how the ancestral molodont jaw operates in order to process food. From
                this base form, shared with only minor deviation by all the species shown below, have come many more
                extreme specializations.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <h2>Simple Seed Eaters with a Big Impact</h2>
        <p>Molodonts evolved as specialist seed-eaters, <strong>overcoming the defenses of their plant prey with the
                most powerful bite forces, for their size, of any animals</strong>. Over the past 50 million years
            of their evolution they have been one of the most pivotal players in the game of life, directly
            influencing ecological trends on a global scale. The early molodonts were almost exclusive seed-eaters
            and proliferated so abundantly through the Pangeacene that they <strong>displaced whole families of
                seed-eating birds, </strong>reducing sparrowgull diversity considerably. <strong>Molodont
                seed-predation, utterly destructive to plants perpetuating their species, has also changed the
                course of tree evolution in several major ways</strong>. Early molodonts reduced the extent of many
            tree species and over millions of years resulted in the decrease in wooded habitat across Serina,
            <strong>aiding the spread of grasslands in the Pangeacene</strong>. Their feeding strongly selected for
            some trees to reduce the size of their seeds, producing many more smaller ones of less appeal to seed
            predators, either hiding them in fruit for animal dispersal or adapting toward increased wind dispersal,
            <strong>and for some ant trees to forgo bearing seeds at all, instead germinating their embryos
                immediately while still attached to the mother plan</strong>t, which are then planted by ant
            symbiotes, in order to successfully reproduce; these groups then rebounded.<strong> A few trees however,
                destined for less long-term success, have found themselves locked in an endless arm's race</strong>,
            growing larger and ever more extreme seeds in virtual fortress-like hulls while some molodonts match
            them at every step and grow even stronger jaws to compensate, resulting in the development of the
            largest seeds ever known -<strong> yet which are so large, they are impossible to disperse, and can only
                grow in their parent's vicinity</strong>; unable to spread, <strong>such aberrant forms now lie in
                increasingly fragmented pockets of a former range.</strong> </p>
        <p>Yet most molodonts have responded to these ecological changes a little less dramatically; as trees adapt
            to avoid their predation, <strong>most have simply become a little more generalistic</strong>, able to
            feed on a variety of foods including seeds, fruit, and small animals - and as they became less intense
            feeding on trees, stability returned to the forest ecology. These more generalized molodonts, searching
            for alternative food sources, also took to <strong>feeding heavily on birds' eggs and in doing so
                provided an intense selective pressure that resulted in several clades of birds evolving to carry
                their eggs with them</strong> and regularly change brooding sites, and so protect them from nest
            raiders - another way these little animals have had far-reaching impacts on their world.</p>
        <p>Generalist seed-eating molodonts occur almost everywhere on Serina today, save the most isolated volcanic
            islands, and belong to several groups both basal and derived, the distinctions between being minor and
            all sharing similar attributes. Many of these animals are arboreal or climbing at least to some extent
            and adapted to feed on tree seeds, though equally if not more abundant are burrowers that feed primarily
            on the seeds grasses and herbs. In all cases molodonts continue to compete intensely with birds and now
            limit them almost entirely from specializing to feed upon seeds as, at one time, every Serinan bird was
            adapted to. This loss is notable, as these basal finch-like canaries had persisted in relative abundance
            on Serina for its entire history, through everything else circumstance could throw. Today these birds
            are at last all but vanished from the landscape.</p>
        <h3>Seed-snatchers</h3>
        <p>One of the most cosmopolitan seed-eating molodont families are the <strong>seed-snatchers</strong>,
            arboreal squirrel-like forms ranging in size from about one ounce to ten pounds in weight at their
            extremes but most at one or two lbs. With limbs well adapted to climb, they spend their whole lives in
            the trees and rarely descend - this habit, different from squirrels, is partly why molodonts over time
            evolved to contribute so little to trees; <strong>while squirrels bury their seeds in the ground and so
                disperse some to sprout, molodonts usually stashed food in gnawed out tree hollows where they will
                never germinate. </strong>The seed-snatchers' teeth are indeed sharper and a little smaller than the
            first molodonts, adapted to exploit many different food resources, though seeds are favored, and to chew
            dens and cache sites into trees. </p>
        <figure><img src="images/wJYQ6Dc.png" alt="cerulean seed-snatcher" /></figure>
        <p><strong>Seed snatchers are social to an extreme</strong>, living in related groups of bonded pairs,
            usually related as siblings, cousins, and parents and grandparents, all of which cooperatively forage
            and raise their young. For such small animals the young spend a long time with the parents, nearly an
            entire year before independence. <strong>The seed-snatchers, though small and seemingly vulnerable, are
                indeed surprisingly long-lived</strong> - they are one of just three tribbethere clades, and two
            within molodonts, <strong>which can lower their metabolism and hibernate in cold weather, making them
                particularly well suited to endure the looming threat of global cooling.</strong> This also has the
            effect of <strong>slowing the process of oxidation in their bodies, lengthening their lifespan.</strong>
            Most such small animals are heavily preyed upon, yet seed-snatchers seem especially skilled at predator
            evasion<strong>; they are small, yet they live in very cohesive family groups that can help watch for
                danger, with each adult individual alternating duty as a lookout, and individuals will gang up on
                threats to protect their own</strong> so that small predators such as eelsnakes, perhaps able to
            easily kill one seed-snatcher, will avoid doing so as they can be overwhelmed by a family group.<strong>
                By combining such complex social behavior with physical camouflage</strong> - their fur very often
            blends into bark or the branches of trees and the nearly bare skin along their snouts and ears can
            lighten or darken under different emotional states to aid in blending in - <strong>seed-snatchers have
                surprisingly subverted the expected role of such small animals in their ecosystems</strong>. With
            few losses to predation, lifespans can exceed ten years. </p>
        <p>Seed-snatcher social groups can grow to hundreds where food is sufficiently abundant, <strong>and such
                cooperative groups of animals make for a very safe environment with so many eyes very little can
                infiltrate</strong>. Yet there does come a time where groups could become so large as to be a
            hindrance, and so population is limited by male dispersal; around six months after sexual maturity young
            males leave their natal clan to pair with a mate in another in an adjacent territory. <strong>This also
                limits harmful inbreeding.</strong></p>
        <h2>Dietary Divergence</h2>
        <p>During the arms race between the molodonts and the seeds of trees, <strong>some molodonts dropped out
                entirely</strong>. Instead of becoming more generalistic, they specialized in other directions. All
            descended at one time from the seed-eaters. It is these more divergent molodonts which today have come
            to dominate terrestrial landscapes. <strong>All of these species and the wider clades they have produced
                have switched diets, and have adapted their seed-smashing jaws for new, novel uses.</p>
        <h3>Poppits</h3>
        <p>Some of the earliest divergent molodonts were those species which transitioned from seeds to the green
            parts of plants. The most successful clade today to have done this were a group of
            secondarily-terrestrial burrowing forms belonging to a clade known as the <strong>Oxyminodonts</strong>
            (<i>"pointed-lower-toothed"</i>), which early in molodont evolution dropped back to the ground from the
            treetops and evolved an elongated lower tooth plate to aid in burrowing and to uproot entire plants,
            first to reach their out of reach seeds and then to eat directly. <strong>The distal edge of the upper
                tooth became sharper and could be clipped against the elongated lower tooth to crop plant matter.
            </strong>The most basal representatives of the oxyminodonts alive today are a genus of small burrowing
            vegetarians found on the grasslands of Serinaustra known as <strong>poppits</strong>, for their "popping
            up" behavior where they peer out from burrows to scout for threats before emerging to feed.</p>
        <figure><img src="images/Kd60oD7.png" alt="prairie poppit" /></figure>
        <p>Poppits are the Serinan equivalent to marmots, pikas, or some mole rats; burrowers that feed mostly on
            the surface, eating primarily grasses, though they also eat a lot of subsurface roots. <strong>Their
                skull anatomy is quite specialized, their eye sockets having moved very high</strong> while the
            braincase has moved low, <strong>which allows them to peer from their burrows while keeping as much of
                their body below the soil line as possible</strong>. They are social and cooperative, communicating
            warnings of danger at a distance not through sound but <strong>conspicuous visual signals provided by
                brightly colored inner ears that flare and retract in a crude language of gestures,</strong> yet
            even with a social system to watch their back they are nonetheless nervous and easily spooked. They take
            that step of faith outside their shelter only with great hesitation and move at a frantic pace, never
            resting as long as they must remain on the surface, for they are defenseless in the open.
            <br /><strong><br />With a long lower tooth useful as a pick axe to tunnel as well as to loosen tubers
                out of the earth, they also utilize it as a scythe.</strong> Hastily scurrying from their tunnels to
            crop grass from the surface, taking mouthfuls and clipping the shoots near ground level, they lay them
            near the burrow entrance and then dash back to safety, carting the resultant hay below ground later
            after it has dried. They still feed on seeds when they come across them but their gut is much enlarged
            and built now for a much coarser diet of foliage, and rather than selectively eating seeds when they
            find them they are more apt to chew up the whole stem. Being small and highly fecund, poppits - unlike
            their distant relatives - have <i>not </i>avoided the fate of being small prey and are heavily preyed
            upon by carnivores such as <strong>repandors</strong> and <strong>spearrunners</strong>, those aberrant
            predatory serezelles that still persist on these southern plains, and thus play a pivotal role in the
            ecology of these environments. </p>
        <p><strong>Tolerant of the cold, they are the second molodont clade capable of winter hibernation</strong> -
            vital in the cold, wind-swept steppe habitat they prefer. Huddling for warmth, they retain their limited
            body heat very efficiently deep below the ground and lower individual metabolic costs. There is risk to
            clumping together, though, in that the motive for predators to find you in your sleep is increased the
            more of you it may find together,<strong> and so some polar bumblebadgers seek out dormant colonies by
                scent, dig them out, and eat them in their torpor</strong>; such concentrated food resources indeed
            sustain these predators in Serina's coldest southern regions in winter, when other prey on the surface
            may be nearly nonexistent. </p>
        <h3>Circuagodonts</h3>
        <p>The <strong>closest relatives</strong> of the poppits are the <strong>circuagodonts</strong>, themselves
            a molodont clade <strong>but a highly divergent one also allied with the poppits in the
                oxyminodonts.</strong> Circuagodonts share the elongated, projecting lower tooth morphology but
            further specialized their upper tooth from a purely masticating structure to a complex wedge-shaped
            cutting tool that clips plant matter in front, against the narrow lower beak, and widens in the rear to
            pulverize it against a broader interior plate inside the mouth as the jaw opens and closes.
            Circuagodonts, in effect, are molodonts that <strong>transformed the ancestral griding, mortar and
                pestle jaw structure into a set of tree trimmers. </strong> Circuagodonts are themselves so large
            and varied a clade, which have experienced their own dietary shifts and niche swaps to such a remarkable
            extent that they will be covered in detail in a following chapter -<strong> their mention here is only
                to show their relationship to the other molodonts.</strong></p>
        <h3>Omniphages</h3>
        <p>Upon Serinarcta can be found an interesting branch of the molodonts, a group of animals of particularly
            massive size and strange appearance, which are despite this considered to be among of the most basal of
            all living species, having diverged nearly 45 million years ago from all other forms alive today. These
            are the <strong>Omniphages</strong>, <span>(<i>"everything eaters"</i>), </span>immense megafaunal
            molodonts which have evolved<strong> hugely wide, smashing jaws to indiscriminately consume food
                resources typically viewed as undesirable to other animals, including rotting wood, thorns, and
                bones.</strong></p>
        <figure><img src="images/8hmZ9Vq.png" alt="thorngrazer" /></figure>
        <p>Notably, members of this clade are thought to have never been arboreal; having never lived in trees, they
            represent an herbivorous molodont that switched directly from grass seeds - likely the first food source
            adopted by the molodonts' terrestrial ancestors - to the grass itself and from there to a variety of
            other things which could incidentally be found among grass. Omniphages represent effectively the
            opposite extreme from the small arboreal molodonts that pick and crush individual seeds;<strong> they
                are broad, indiscriminate eaters that evolved to pick up, crush and devour anything in the vicinity,
                plant or animal, in wide gnashing mouthfuls</strong>. This let them get the maximum nutrition they
            could find in low-productivity environments like dry plains yet required a large fermenting stomach, and
            <strong>so the omniphages became giants, the heaviest of all tribbetheres on land</strong> and approach
            the <strong>theoretical maximum weight for a tripodal tribbethere,</strong> which must <strong>bear all
                of its weight on the single hind limb during part of the walk cycle</strong> - up to 1,500 lbs. They
            are heavily built, with stocky, straight limbs and elephantine feet, but their enormous heads are the
            most noticeable feature, supporting immense pulverizing jaws that can grind virtually anything, even
            small stones taken incidentally in feeding, to a crumbling powder or a paste that is swallow-able. </p>
        <p>Omniphages include preferential grazers, scavengers, and browsers; most species though will readily
            consume any sort of organic matter however <strong>and have a flexible digestive system to allow them to
                survive on a wider variety of food, and lower quality of food, than almost anything else alive.
            </strong>Meat digests quickly in the foregut and so nutrients move through the stomach in a short time,
            while coarse ground plant matter collects in a large fermenting hindgut for up to several days before
            being thoroughly digested; symbiotic bacteria let all species digest cellulose. <strong>The stomach,
                combined with the digestion that occurs in the mouth via saliva, is so efficient that almost nothing
                is wasted;</strong> the feces produced afterwards is predominately their own dead cell waste and a
            sandy powder of minerals - <strong>even traces of organic matter in dirt and mud can be
                digested.</strong></p>
        <p>One of the most visually unique omniphages is the <strong>thorngrazer</strong>, a mostly herbivorous
            species native to the dry scrublands of northeast Serinarcta that has become a specialist in eating
            thorny desert plants. In another evolutionary arms race, the thorngrazer evolves to feed on ever more
            fiercely defended foliage, while its prey responds with increasingly extreme defensive measures.
            <strong>Currently the thorngrazer is winning this race</strong>, able to engulf huge mouthfuls of
            foliage with spines long and sharp enough to skewer a man through the gut and out the back, <strong>but
                it has only achieved this tolerance with extreme physical defenses of its own.</strong> The lips,
            the eyelids, the inside of the mouth, the nostrils, the throat, and even upper stomach of the
            thorngrazer is lined with <strong>hard, sharp keratinized spines</strong>, which protect its own tissues
            from the deadly defenses of its food. As the sole species able to access the liquid water found in these
            plants, which is after all what they ultimately strive to protect in the arid climate,<strong>
                thorngrazers are a keystone species that allow many invertebrates and birds to survive in climates
                which may lack free standing water for 90% of the year</strong>. Small animals follow the solitary
            thorngrazers like a small entourage, quickly drinking the oozing sap or chewing the soft inner flesh of
            the plants to quench their thirst in the mere minutes before the sun dries the wounds and the plants
            begin to cover their injuries with woody scabs. </p>
        <p>Due to the extremes of their diet and the specialization they must grow to handle it, thorngrazers - born
            without teeth or spines - <strong>have a very long period of infantile dependency on their
                mothers</strong> and cannot feed themselves for as long as eighteen months. <strong>To nourish her
                young when she herself eats only the most low-nutrition diet, she as well as others of her clade
                bear a milk-like food source for their young</strong>; this is actually a fatty <strong>slurry of
                cells that sloughs off of the lining off the foregut</strong>; rich in fat and protein, the young
            eats almost nothing else but this sticky, pus-like slurry of cell tissue regurgitated by its mother
            until it is mature enough to begin handling the coarse adult diet. <span>To lick this substance from the
                mother's mouth, the young thorngrazer, as well as some other omniphages, uses something no other
                molodont still has - <strong>a tongue.</strong> While most <strong>molodonts lost their tongues, as
                    they are useless and a hindrance in their crushing mouths,</strong> this basal clade retains
                them in infancy as the spines on many of their faces as adults prevent the adults from locking lips
                with the young to transfer food as other tribbetheres do.</span></p>
        <p>Mostly hairless, the thorngrazer is able to fire up or down the pigment in its skin to help regulate its
            body temperature, varying from pale tan to almost black depending on the time of day, for nights and
            days in the desert can bring incredible temperature swings. Males also sport bright red and orange
            patches of pigment which can be flared to high intensities during combat or courtship and muted at other
            times. </p>
