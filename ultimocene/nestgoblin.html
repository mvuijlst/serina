        <h1>The Nest Goblin</h1>
        <h2>The Weird Uncle</h2>
        <p>Tribbetheres are experiencing great success at the start of the Ultimocene. </strong>Large terrestrial forms
            such as circuagodonts have outcompeted many birds on land while tribbats compete with them in the air. One
            especially strange group of tribbet which is just outside the tribbethere crown group, though, does not
            merely displace or hunt Serina's birds.<strong> It relies on their own instincts to exploit them for its own
                gain.</strong></p>
        <h2>The Nest Goblin</h2>
        <p><strong>It is late spring, nearing Summer in the temperature forests of Serinarcta</strong>. Many species of
            the passerine-like <strong>sparrowgulls</strong>, a clade of neo-perching birds derived from an earlier
            radiation of seabird canaries, have spent the past few months incubating eggs and raising chicks, and now
            many of those young birds have begun testing their wings and leaving the nest. Across a verdant woodland,
            newly green and in full glory as the warm season approaches its pinnacle, scraggly, clumsy young birds
            flutter from their nests to low branches. They chirp and squeak, flicking their wings and opening their
            mouths to reveal the wide red gapes and soft colorful skin flanges on their lips that signal to their
            parents to feed them. Most species still around now are insectivores, and adult birds, resembling jays and
            magpies, <strong>flit tirelessly from one chick to the next without rest, stuffing gullets with worms and
                crickets and the bug-like larvae of much stranger avian species. </strong></p>
        <figure><img alt="goblin" src="images/uumD2MJ.png" /></figure>
        <p>Some chicks, through lack of skill, tumble to the ground in their maiden voyage. Most typically hop around
            and find a perch to flap up to quickly, but as soon as this occurs, something strange happens. Hearing the
            calls of the hungry chicks as they leave their nests, a strange, awkward-looking creature's face peers out
            of a hole at the base of a tree. Wide, glassy eyes stare out blankly, as a creature who seems to show none
            of the high cognitive ability of other tribbetheres emerges from a long slumber for its first meal in half a
            year or longer.<strong> It is lanky, totally hairless, with grotesquely large ears and a pointed
                snout.</strong> Long pointed fingers, crusted in the dirt they dug into last autumn, point outward on
            arms that are still not fully erect. As others emerge from their long hibernation under the forest soil,
            they resemble the most uncomfortable fusion of an ancient tribbethere ancestor otherwise long gone from this
            world, the <strong>hopper</strong>, from which all tribbetheres arose in the late Thermocene - and something
            very much from a nightmare. They are <strong>nest goblins</strong> - the most primitive representatives on
            the line that led to the tribbetheres, a species intermediate between them and the reptile-grade ectothermic
            <strong>tribtiles</strong>.</p>
        <p>And the calls of the bird chicks make them <strong>very, very excited for their first meal in many
                months.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>The goblins are attracted by the calls of the fledgeling sparrowgulls </strong>as they leave their
            nests. They emerge from the dirt like zombies brought to life, pushing the soil away with their spade-like
            hand, and scurry over the earth like large toads toward the hapless nestlings. The chicks, young and naive,
            don't run, as the goblins open up their long narrow mouths to reveal shockingly wide gapes lined with small
            needle-like teeth... <strong>and begin, with flawless vocal mimicry, to imitate the baby bird's plaintive
                peeping, but several times louder, so that it drowns out the birds' own voices in the hum of the forest.
            </strong> </p>
        <p>It does not go unnoticed by the parent birds, frantically trying to keep watch of their own chicks as they
            scatter to the winds around the nest. Hearing the nest goblin's unmistakable cries of hunger, they respond.
            In the shadow of the forest floor, they see only a crying, red mouth and do as instinct tells them; to stuff
            it with food. <strong>The adult bird lands on the ground next to the goblin, ignoring its own chicks
                elsewhere in the forest, and feeds it as if it were it own young</strong>. Because, as far as it can
            tell, it must be - the identically imitated voice of its young, uniquely recognizable, is a cue that
            evolution has endowed this parent bird to recognize.</p>
        <p> As it is fed, the goblin hastily gobbles down its fare, <strong>but unlike the real chick, it is never
                satiated. </strong>It continues to scream for food, getting only more loud the more it is fed,
            <strong>so that the parent bird works constantly to provide ever more for this nightmarish replacement of
                its own young, which soon grows from lanky to plump.</strong> Eventually, within weeks, the parent
            bird's own young have either starved or managed to learn to feed on their own and the adult's instincts tell
            it to move on; but the nest goblin is only just starting its season of plenty.</p>
        <p><strong>The goblin, despite its initial seeming lack of intellect, is a master manipulator and a social
                learner.</strong> Not all birds are easily fooled by a generic red gape and an imitated cry; other
            visual and behavioral cues are required, <strong>which the goblin must learn.</strong> If a parent bird is
            unconvinced by its generic, instinctive ploy, the goblin will retreat to the sidelines and observe the bird
            very closely as it feeds its own offspring. It registers the subtle behavioral cues of the chick, such as
            the way it may hold its wings or position its head. It listens close, to learn its voice. And with its
            excellent eyesight, it takes close note of its coloration. And when the adult returns again with food, it is
            ready. It jumps from the undergrowth, mouth agape, having adjusted the pigment in its skin to such a degree
            that it now reflects the exact mouth markings of the parents' own chick; <strong>traits which evolve in many
                birds to easily distinguish species from one another - but evolution cannot adapt in a single day to an
                alien exploiting an ancient system.</strong> Not only does it emulate the mouth patterns, but the
            feather patterns, though to a lesser degree; it copies patterns of light and dark onto its own skin. And for
            species which flick their wings when begging for food as many do, it precisely does so too - using its
            enormous ears to approximate wings. Though to us, the bizarre, big-eared goblin - an animal that resembles a
            toad mixed with a bat - does not come close to resembling a bird chick, <strong>the goblin's trick covers
                every base from which a parent bird identifies its offspring; sound, sight, and behavior. </strong>Even
            the most particular sparrowgull parent cannot resist the super-stimulus of the nest goblin now. </p>
        <figure><img alt="nest goblin" src="images/PoZAchv.png" /></figure>
        <p><strong>Nest goblins, in just the few months of the year while bird chicks are fledging their nests, gain all
                the calories they will require for the entire year. </strong>While many bird chicks starve, the goblins
            that have stolen all of their parents' time and attention become morbidly obese. Fed around the clock for
            weeks without having to move, they swell with so much stored fat that they can barely walk. When the birds
            finish breeding and begin to molt, losing their seasonal hormones and becoming apathetic to the begging of
            chicks, the goblins eventually give up. <strong>As summer turns to fall and the birds move on, the nest
                goblins turn their attentions to each other and mate. </strong></p>
        <p>They then return to the earth. They dig holes around themselves in sheltered places with their forearms,
            digging in backwards like frogs until they can cover themselves with dirt and leaves. So hidden, they slow
            their metabolisms drastically; a body temperature already just on the verge of endothermy and prone to
            fluctuation drops to ambient temperature. <strong>The goblin goes into a deep torpor, and as the winter cold
                arrives, it freezes nearly solid</strong> - only antifreeze properties in its blood prevents its cells
            from bursting and killing it from the inside out. For up to nine months, it does not move. It shrinks, using
            its stored fat to survive, so that when the calls of the birds the next spring finally do wake it, it has
            again become gaunt. Females - which tend to accumulate even more fat than males - w<strong>ill have gestated
                an embryo all through their dormancy and give birth to a single enormous pup</strong>, about 50% of its
            parents size, upon waking, <strong>which is an independent trickster from birth.</strong></p>
        <p>With such an easy source of food and a life free of stress, able to effectively shut itself off for most of
            the year, the nest goblin potentially can survive for a very long time - up to fifty years. <strong>Thanks
                to a combination of novel behavioral and physical adaptation, this last aberrant hopper has found a
                place, for now, to survive a changing world.</strong></p>
        <figure><img src="images/eeHw9jn.png" alt="nest goblin" /></figure>
        <p><strong>Nest goblins likely evolved from frog-like ambush predators.</strong> Adapted to move little and put
            on much weight by catching small animals that came by, they likely once ate bird chicks. Over time, however,
            some may have adapted a colorful mouth that could be opened as a threat display to scare off enemies - adult
            birds that might attack them. T<strong>hrough coincidence and crossing of behavioral wires, a sufficiently
                wide red mouth would perhaps trigger a parent bird's instinct to feed its young</strong>; provided a
            free meal, these goblin ancestors would have a new source of calories. Over time, the modern nest goblin
            seems to have evolved to exploit this resource exclusively, <strong>ceasing to hunt anything on its own
                accord and becoming almost sedentary. </strong></p>

        <p>Fun fact: Birds have been documented feeding fish on Earth; cardinals are sometimes tricked by the red gape
            of hungry goldfish in garden ponds, feeding the fish as if they were their own young!</p>
