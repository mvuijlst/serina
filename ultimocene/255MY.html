        <h1>Things will never be this good again...</h1>
        <p>The <strong>Ultimocene </strong>epoch advances another five million years. Though on the surface the world is
            still hospitable, with thriving life from pole to pole, <strong>beneath the planet's crust the mantle is
                cooling down and the first hints of coming instability have come to light. </strong>The process of
            subduction, when two continental plates collide, is slowing a little every year, and with it slows the
            formation of mountain ranges.<strong> Far beneath the surface of Serina, things are beginning to
                change</strong>. Volcanism is decreasing overall, but not evenly. <strong>As the mantle cools, it is
                becoming unpredictable on very short time scales </strong>- lulls of a few thousand years result in
            global cooling and are followed by similarly brief periods of heavy volcanic emissions, resulting in a pulse
            of atmospheric carbon dioxide that warms the atmosphere several degrees and allows the spread of tropical
            rainforests north and south from the equator. In just a few thousand years more, however, the excess carbon
            is cycled back into the ground, and the climate returns to its default cooler state. Glaciers form around
            the south pole and then creep north across Serinaustra, pushing the forests back to a narrow equatorial band
            and restoring the extent of the Serinaustran steppe.</p>
        <p><strong>Ecosystems begin to change</strong>; not to be lost entirely, <strong>but to shift and move quickly
                in geologic time from one place to another, and back</strong>, in roughly predictable cycles. Grasslands
            and forests displace one another as the climate swings back and forth, followed by their inhabitant
            wildlife, yet some adapt better to the swing of the climate pendulum than others. Nomadic grazers, among
            them the <strong>circuagodonts </strong>and the <strong>giant archangels</strong>, follow the changing
            plains over tens of generations with little difficulty and continue to thrive. <strong>During warm periods
                forest-dwelling wildlife follows the expanding jungles north and south and experience population booms,
                but may find themselves isolated when climates cool and become drier,</strong> as the forests often
            recede unevenly. During each cycle some patches of this once contiguous forest, protected in a favorable
            microclimate, are left a little longer than the rest whilst the climate shifts around them. When the climate
            changes so that even these last holdouts can no longer support this now out of place forest, the animals
            find themselves trapped on what amount to islands on the plains and are unable to move back toward the
            equator. When the last trees die, these trapped organisms also perish. <strong>These micro-extinctions, most
                often occurring only upon a local, not a global scale, with organisms that still survive elsewhere,
                nonetheless provide a glimpse into a future where such changes have much wider, drastic repercussions.
            </strong></p>
        <p><strong>But even with the first hints of an uncertain future ahead now on the horizon,</strong> Serina as a
            whole is still thriving in the early Ultimocene. Truly equatorial habitats, where the vast majority of
            biodiversity is found, are little affected by the climate fluctuations that affect the polar regions. Here
            life continues as it has for tens of millions of years - and that life is thriving; yet this time, it is
            perhaps all the more important to cherish, because the clock is now definitively ticking, and these good
            times too will come to an end, as all things do.</p>
        <p><strong>Life on Serina has experienced many ups and downs in its history, but the current period is
                different.</strong> Every good time comes to its eventual end, but this time, the end will be final.
            When the curtains of past epochs of a similar grandeur closed - the Hypostecene as well as the Thermocene -
            times were trying, even devastating - but only for a time. There was loss, but life recovered afterwards to
            and even beyond its previous levels of biodiversity as conditions improved. But Serina was younger then,
            more stable. <strong>Now, as happens to everything in the cosmos from flowers to stars, Serina itself is
                dying. </strong></p>
        <p>It is not dying a sudden, explosive, or particularly violent death like the Pangeacene-Thermocene extinction
            event. There will be no sudden moment of clarity before all cuts to black. There shall be no definitive time
            where good times become bad times, as after an asteroid strike.<strong> But change is coming, bit by bit and
                year by year. The climate is going to get colder. There will never again be as much biodiversity, either
                by species or ton per ton, upon Serina as exists at this very moment. </strong>As the Ultimocene
            advances, the result will be a steady but inevitable decline of life from this point forward, eventually
            resulting in the end of all life, <strong>which will occur after approximately 300 million years of
                adaptation, innovation, and ultimately, extinction.</strong> 255 million years have already amassed;
            about 50 million more remain. This is a very long time, almost as long as has amassed on Earth from the end
            of the dinosaurs until the evolution of modern man. The difference, however, is that throughout the
            remaining period, environmental conditions will become more quickly less and less hospitable - not more so,
            as following most extinction events, <strong>because the Ultimocene is not an extinction event, but simply
                the beginning of an end. </strong></p>
        <p><strong>There will be successes still to be found by certain branches of the tree of life for tens of
                millions of years to come. </strong>Even in the harshest situation, there is some creature ideally
            suited to exploit all that the world can throw its way and thrive despite. The climax of life on the whole,
            however - the high point of all that ever was or will be on the world of birds - is right now. </p>
        <p><strong>Things will never be this good again, as the curtain rises on Serina's finale.</p>
