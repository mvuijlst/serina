        <h1>The Seamingo</h1>
        <p><strong>A flock of a hundred colorful orange birds glide low over a calm green ocean. </strong>With narrow
            pointed wings and a long thin neck that projects forward, they are well-suited to soar over the water with a
            minimum of wing beats. Flight feathers line their webbed hind legs, providing additional lift. With
            wingspans of up to fifteen feet they soar majestically, calling with warbling, melodious calls to one
            another. As the flock descends, they lower their hind legs and smoothly fold up their flight feathers by the
            use of a mobile fifth digit - a stabilizing rod that has evolved on the outer edge of the foot to provide
            better control of the hind wing. Finally, with a splash, each of the large birds settles onto the water with
            its hind legs down paddling and its forewings tucked along its sides, the long feathered flight fingers
            angling outward and behind it. <strong>Their bills have a strange furry appearance, both the top and bottom
                jaws being lined with a sieve of extremely fine bristles of keratin.</strong>They dip their snouts into
            the water and begin quickly sucking water into their crops until their throats are visibly inflated. Once
            this storage structure is full, they close their bills and begin to pump it back out again through the
            mouth. <strong>The water now escapes through through the bristles that serve like a net to filter the
                released water of its phytoplankton, which provides the main source of food for these elegant water
                birds</strong>. Once their crops are drained, they repeat the process until their stomachs are full of
            the nutritious algae,<strong> the carotenoids contained within being sequestered into their otherwise white
                plumage and providing them with their vibrant orange coloration</strong>. Though they also consume
            considerable quantities of microscopic crustaceans, their main diet is a vegetarian one.</p>
        <p>They are the <strong>seamingos </strong>and they are descended from the flying metamorph giants known as
            <strong>archangels</strong>. More specifically, they are some of the more uniquely adapted members of a now
            common and highly diverse clade of quadrupedal metamorph birds collectively known as
            <strong>quaddles</strong> - "quad" referring to their four-legged walking gait, combined with "waddle" as a
            result of their convergent evolution to ducks - <strong>that have evolved to fill the niches of
                waterfowl.</strong> Mostly than their ancestors, many different quaddle species, all of which originally
            evolved from the giant grazers, now have become adapted to feed in marshes, rivers and lakes upon the varied
            food sources they can provide. Some dabble for water plants and others feed on crustaceans, but the
            seamingos uniquely have become filter-feeders on the open ocean, sifting the fertile shallow seas for
            microscopic phytoplankton growing just below the surface with highly elongated bill serrations used by their
            ancestor to crop vegetation. <strong>While on Earth such a niche is possible for birds to exploit only in a
                few places, particularly salt lakes and some freshwater environments, the more fertile shallow oceans of
                Serina mean that algae grows abundantly enough to support flocks of nomadic filter-feeding birds that
                spend most of their life out to sea</strong>, soaring on the wind and landing to feed on the thickest
            algal blooms that pop up across the waters. As their ancestors crossed thousands of miles over land in
            search of seasonal flushes of green grass, the seamingos now do over the high seas, searching for blooms of
            the algae that nourishes them.</p>

        </figure>
        <p>The seamingos cavort and feed, swimming slowly forward with their heads stretched forward and down, swishing
            their flat bills over the surface of the water and sucking it in and out through their filtering plates.
            They cackle quietly but constantly among one another, occasionally dipping their head beneath the surface to
            grab a clump of seaweed. If the water stays calm enough, they will feed for several hours and then rest,
            tucking their heads back into their plumage and bobbing on the water like buoys. They may spend days at a
            time floating on a particularly dense patch, but eventually, once well-fed and rested, the flock will lift
            off again. Though as heavy as swans and even more lanky, they take off vertically from the surface of the
            water, propelling themselves predominately with a powerful push of their wings against its surface that is
            of sufficient strength to vault them into the wind. A few strong, rapid wing beats is then all it takes to
            become fully airborne and ride the wind again to the next feeding ground. Different species of them occur
            over all the planet's seasexcept the most extremely polar, taking advantage of blooms of algae wherever they
            occur. Because the largest blooms are unpredictable and widely spaced far out to sea, it would be difficult
            for the seamingos to partake in such a diet were they tied to raising their offspring for a prolonged period
            at a nesting colony as are the sparrowgulls and seabirds of epochs past. <strong>Fortunately the seamingos'
                ancestors long ago solved that issue for them - all archangels have forgone parental care.</strong> The
            males never come to land, even molting at sea through a drawn-out process that occurs gradually enough that
            the bird is never incapable of flight at any one time. The females fly ashore just once a year, after the
            age of two or three, to bury their eggs communally on warm tropical beaches and leave incubation to the sun.
            When the chicks finally hatch they are fully independent and so well developed as to be capable of flight
            immediately. Under cover of darkness, synchronized over a few days, they take to the air and instinctively
            head toward the ocean.</p>
        <p><strong>The young chicks spend their first few months in shallow coastal waters where they feed differently
                from the adults on account of a less specialized anatomy.</strong> Their filter feeding apparatus is not
            yet developed and their bills at this age more closely resemble those of other archangels - or earth
            waterfowl - with only small serrations present that will eventually transition into the seining bristles of
            the adult's beak. Until this occurs they have a broader diet of water plants, algae and most importantly
            small fish and crustaceans that provide the protein they require to quickly reach their adult size. Within
            six months to a year their bills begin to take on the form of the adult. <strong>Slowly the tips of both
                their upper and lower mandibles begin to grow apart so that when the transition is completed the
                seamingo is unable to fully close them together</strong> - instead, the interlocking siene of bristles
            from both mandibles grow to meet in the gap, producing a structure perfectly designed to let out water
            without letting out nutriment. As this occurs they shift their diet increasingly toward free-floating algae
            and begin to move further out to sea, seeking out others of their species and beginning their nomadic adult
            lifestyle. Even at a day of age however the young seamingo is independent of land and can adeptly glide over
            the waves and float on the sea's surface to feed, swishing their beaks across the surface to grab small
            zooplankton or scraping along the blades of sea bamboo to find small creatures hiding there. Though
            seamingos can soar they cannot sleep on the wing like some seabirds and so must land on the water to rest.
            Flocks float bunched together to sleep for safety, tightly packed in aggregations of dozens or hundreds.
            <strong>To stay together while asleep roosting seamingos hold hands, grasping one another with the two
                clawed digits on their wings to secure themselves together so the group is not broken apart by waves.
            </strong>They float like corks - a result of highly pneumatic bones and a body strewn with airsacs, and even
            the newborns are waterproof; their preen oil gland is large and fully functional out of the egg and their
            plumage is kept waterproof with frequent grooming. </p>
        <p>Seamingo chicks hatch out pearly white, obtaining their orange color within three months once they begin to
            store carotenoids from their diet in their bodies and molt out their first set of natal plumage. They do not
            obtain their brightest plumage until they transition to their adult diet at the age of six months to a year.
            Though their choice of food turns them pink or orange, seamingos are actually all predominately white birds
            just like their ancestors, with very little melanin in their plumage - only their wingtips, where melanin
            strengthens the feathers and provides resistance to wear, and sometimes markings upon the head and neck are
            produced via melanin. A separate yellow pigment does occur in their plumage however, the very same one that
            gave the original canary bird its own color, which is actually responsible for the orange coloration of most
            seamingos. When combined with the carotenoids in their plumage it produces such lovely shades of warm
            orange; species that produce less yellow pigment are pink or red.</p>
