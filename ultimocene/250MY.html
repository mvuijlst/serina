        <h2>The Land</h2>
        <p>The beginning of the Ultimocene features three major continents divided from the single land mass of the
            Pangeacene. The northern half of the former super continent comprising the combined remnants of North
            Anciska, Polar Anciska, and much of Wahlteria has broken away and begun to move northwest, forming a new
            large landmass centered on the equator known as <strong>Serinarcta</strong>. The almost identically sized
            southern portion which originally consisted of South Anciska, Stevhlandea, and Karii has moved easterly but
            remained along the south pole, and comes to be known as <strong>Serinaustra</strong>. A portion of the south
            has broken away in the west; composed of parts of South Anciska and stevhlandea, it becomes the third,
            smallest continent known as <strong>Ansteva.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>For now, the north and south are divided by a seaway, but their divorce will not be permanent.
            </strong>As the climate fluctuates over the next few tens of millions of years, land bridges will form,
            flood, and reappear between them several times as glaciers freeze and melt, radically altering global sea
            levels. Life will continue to move back and forth between them each time the bridge returns,
            a<strong>llowing for a steady stream of ecological interchange throughout the early Ultimocene.</strong></p>
        <p>The Ultimocene starts off mild. The climate is cooler and much wetter than most of the Pangeacene, and a
            small ice cap exists at the south pole. The enormous interior desert has disappeared, and now forests,
            varying from temperate to tropical, have come to cover most of the world. The equator supports enormous,
            diverse rainforests, while in the south a productive steppe biome has appeared that covers much of
            Serinaustra, the productivity of which rivals the Serengeti. Volcanism is currently in a lull over the
            majority of the moon,<strong> but a hot spot in the eastern sea has appeared </strong>and produced a new
            series of tropical islands, the <strong>Meridians.</strong></p>
        <h2>The Life</h2>
        <p><strong>Sunflower myrmecophytes</strong> remain the dominant forest community across Serina into the early
            Ultimocene, and <strong>the adaptation of producing fully-formed seedlings which then disperse on the wind
                instead of seeds is becoming widespread</strong>. Ant-symbiotic sunflower trees follow in the footsteps
            of bamboo yet again and colonize the coasts, forming a new mangrove biome. <strong>Nanboo </strong>continues
            to survive worldwide, but only the equatorial jungles on Serinarcta can still support them at their greatest
            diversity, where they still form large clonal forests. <strong>Serinarcta is predominately forested, but
                Serinaustra is comparably arid</strong>, particularly in the south. <strong>Though the interior desert
                has broken up into small scattered fragments, a large expanse of puffgrass steppe now occurs around the
                south pole that supports huge numbers of grazers.</strong> <strong>Cactus sunflowers </strong>from the
            interior desert adapt to a wetter climate near the south pole as they have done in the past, <strong>by
                becoming conifer-like trees with cold-resistant scales and needles in place of leaves </strong>and
            forming a ring of dense taiga forest around the steppe. A similar ecosystem has developed in the far north,
            but from a different plant. Here, <strong>tall grass-descended trees</strong> have developed sharp
            lance-like leaves full of bitter resin to keep them from freezing and a columnar growth habit suited to
            shedding snow, and fill the same niche.</p>
        <p><strong>Most animal groups evolved during the Pangeacene will persist through the early Ultimocene.</strong>
            <strong>Molodon</strong>t diversity has never been higher; <strong>wheeljaws</strong> (circuagodonts)
            especially have experienced incredible success since their appearance more than 20 million years ago
            <strong>and have become both the most abundant large herbivores and carnivores across Serina</strong>.
            <strong>Serezelles </strong>fare poorly against circuagodont competitors and are in sharp decline, yet one
            group, the <strong>boomsingers</strong>, still experiences success by growing taller and accessing food
            resources beyond their reach. <strong>The circuagodonts' more primitive competitors, the dogbeasts, have
                experienced a degree of decline,</strong> certainly for the same reason, with the exception of their
            aquatic descendants, <strong>mertribs</strong>, which have diversified well as a clade and spread across all
            of Serina's oceans. They are not out, though, with new forms evolving to remain competitive in this rapidly
            changing world.</p>
        <p><strong>Tribbetheres</strong> have now largely driven most other bird groups back off the ground and into
            either the air or the sea, with the exception of the live-bearing <strong>bumblets</strong>. Basal burrowing
            species still persist, filling the niches of moles and shrews across Serina and largely succeeding in
            excluding the more rodent-like molodonts from developing similar small, hypercarnivorous forms.
            <strong>Marine bumblets</strong>, meanwhile, have given rise to the largest birds ever to exist in the form
            of giant filter-feeders, and others which are now the apex predators of the sea.</p>
        <p>Waterfowl are still extant, but dwindling in diversity compared to their numbers in the Pangeacene, possibly
            due to their exposed ground-based nests being highly vulnerable to egg-eating moldoonts. A few
            <strong>softbilled birds,</strong> descendants of the <strong>glove</strong> and the
            <strong>mitten</strong>, also survive, though their group is now in decline for the same reason. Though the
            bludgebird has died out, <strong>other mitten descendants have adapted to different environments,
                particularly the forests which are now so widespread,</strong> where they learn to shelter their nests
            in tree hollows for relative protection. <strong>Some descendants of the glove specialize as burrowing
                ambush predators</strong>. Aquatic forms, such as the <strong>manatweets</strong>, continue to thrive in
            the shallow vegetated seas, but ancestral semi-aquatic species have been displaced by bumblets. </p>
        <p><strong>Sparrowgulls</strong> also thrive at the start of the Ultimocene. To protect their eggs from new,
            pervasive molodont predators, <strong>they use their relatively high intelligence and learn to carry their
                eggs and move their nestlings if they feel their nest is vulnerable</strong>, a skill which so far has
            been uncommon in egg-laying birds; some mitten descendants utilize the same trick. The inability for Serinan
            waterfowl to do so is presumably a major factor in their relative lack of reproductive success since the
            diversity boom of molodonts.</p>
        <p><strong>Many groups of primitive changelings - metamorph birds - are slowly dying out as sparrowgulls
                displace them, leaving only the most derived lineages extant.</strong> They survive now as
            <strong>highly derived small flyers</strong> with aquatic or parasitic larvae, <strong>ornimorphs
            </strong>which progress through a number of highly disparate life stages culminating in a fully airborne
            adult form, as <strong>fully neotenic aquatic species, and as live-bearing placental birds which have long
                since abandoned their larval stages altogether.</strong> Flying <strong>quadruped birds</strong>
            including <strong>archangels</strong> are still extant, but as the climate cools the regions in which the
            largest species can reproduce become more restricted, causing many species to become migratory. The largest
            archangels now fly south to the cold southern steppe in the summer to graze and fatten upon lush grasses and
            then return to the equator to lay their eggs, where their young initially mature and feed on a more
            omnivorous diet in the tropical wetlands. <strong>Smaller species develop in response to the changing
                climate</strong>, which can hatch more quickly in the summer in temperate climates. <strong>A clade of
                small archangels become semi-aquatic like geese, ducks, and grebes</strong>, where the adults feed in
            wetlands or near water and in some species only come on land to lay their eggs, which are buried in the
            river bank and left to mature on their own. When confronted with egg-eating molodonts, this is apparently a
            more successful strategy than trying to incubate hard-shelled eggs in exposed nests, and <strong>in time
                these waterfowl archangels will fully replace the last of the primitive water birds.</strong></p>
        <p>In the sea, Serina's intelligent marine snails, <strong>snarks</strong>, are thriving at the start of the
            Ultimocene, and semi-aquatic forms begin now to experiment in life out of water in mangrove forests.
            <strong>Reef-building snails</strong> which thrived through the Pangeacene are also still present and
            successful toward the start of the Ultimocene, but <strong>periodic bursts of volcanic activity, which
                release large amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, will result in several ocean acidification
                events that weaken them substantially</strong> as the epoch wears on. <strong>Sea bamboo </strong>fares
            better, and thrives across all of Serina's shallow seas, including those which would formerly have been too
            cool, as new kelp-like species adapt to the changing climate and make the most of fertile polar
            oceans.<strong> Chainjellies </strong>persist in the tropics, especially in nutrient-poor regions, where
            they survive through a combination of passive filter-feeding and photosynthesis. <strong>Burdles
            </strong>are still successful, and forms that can regulate their body temperatures reappear as the global
            oceans cool, allowing them to feed toward the fertile polar regions. <strong>Other burdles move inland, into
                freshwater rivers and ponds, and converge upon crocodiles</strong> - scaly ambush predators with
            elongated beaks that prey on fish, water birds, and any unfortunate land animals coming to drink. Other than
            burdles, <strong>the muck lineage is by this time almost completely extinct</strong>, except for a single
            family of very different land animals that include <strong>armored insectivores</strong> and a single
            enormous herbivore.</p>
        <p><strong>Mudwickets</strong> and <strong>non-tribbethere tribbets</strong> remain successful in primitive
            forms. <strong>Predatory legless tribbets, which move on scaly bellies like snakes, are some of the most
                widespread</strong>, but they have not displaced an older lineage of a similar form, the
            <strong>eelsnakes</strong>. Eelsnakes never made the complete leap from an aquatic to a terrestrial
            existence and survived through the entire Pangeacene and beyond as semi-aquatic predators which can move
            over land in wet conditions and often estivate in the mud to survive dry spells, much like lungfish. The
            largest species hunt like crocodiles and rarely leave the water, and many can transition readily between
            fresh and salt water. <strong>Being more cold-tolerant than even the most adaptable burdle, they can survive
                as far south as the southern steppe</strong>, where in the summer they swim inland from the sea through
            the mouths of rivers to prey on the seasonal influx of grazers. </p>
        <p><strong>Handfishes</strong> are at their most diverse at the start of the Ultimocene. <strong>Gibbets
            </strong>and <strong>dropdowns </strong>thrive in the tropical forests and begin moving into cooler
            climates, surviving the winter by hibernating, abilities that will allow them to continue to survive in a
            changing world. <strong>Some tropical handfishes develop skin membranes on their front legs, become
                parachutists, and even approach powered flight in their pursuit of flying insect prey</strong>. Many
            gibbets reduce their dependence on animal prey and begin to eat mostly fruit and plant matter,
            <strong>evolving into primate-like animals</strong> that compete with <strong>tribbats.</strong> Behavioral
            adaptations occur between the two groups in response to this competition for resources which causes many
            frugivorous gibbets to become nocturnal. This not only lets them avoid day-flying frugivore tribbets,
            <strong>but also more dangerous carnivorous species</strong>. By the Ultimocene many well-adapted predatory
            tribbats have evolved, most of which hunt by day.</p>
        <p>The world is changing, but life not out yet as we enter the Ultimocene.</p></p>
