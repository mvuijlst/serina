        <h1>Life in the Ant Forest: The Lumberbeest</h1>
        <p><strong>The warmer forests near the tropics across central Serinarcta support incredibly high numbers of
                ants.</strong> Here, it seems that nearly every tree is covered in a constant stream of tiny moving
            bodies, running to defend their hosts whenever they are threatened with a barrage of irritating bites or
            stings. Most of the ants are not particularly aggressive, merely irritating, but they are nonetheless enough
            of an inconvenience as they gather in swarms to keep the various large browsers of the forest moving from
            branch to branch, never lingering long enough to cause significant damage to any one tree. Most symbiote
            ants are selective defenders, paying no mind to a carnivore brushing past or a fruit-eater leaping through
            the branches; they concentrate their aggression on active plant predators, herbivores physically damaging
            their host trees, <strong>which release volatile organic compounds into the air when physically damaged
            </strong>- pheromone signals which the ants have evolved to understand and respond to as a cry for
            help.<strong> Within a minute of a browsing bird or molodont starting to chew on its stems, the sunflower
                tree will have called its armies; in another minute or two, the ants will have gathered at the site of
                the attack in sufficiently large numbers to drive off the hungry animal,</strong> climbing into feathers
            or fur and biting at the exposed skin of lips, noses and eyes. Herbivores must be very attentive when
            browsing, as not only will the ants of a single tree respond to the cries of their host, but ants in
            adjacent trees downwind will also pick up the alarm and be ready should the browser come chomping in their
            direction. They must approach all food sources downwind and move into the breeze as they go, spending just a
            few minutes nibbling at each branch. <strong>Some herbivores cheat the system by adopting new methods of
                browsing without leaving time for the swarms of ants to reach them,</strong> such as breaking off single
            large branches, shaking them vigorously to dislodge any of the insects, and carrying them away to strip off
            the unprotected leaves. The vegetable food resources of the ant forest are still attainable enough to
            support many herbivores, but require considerably more ingenuity to obtain than unprotected vegetation that
            may be nibbled at leisure. <strong>The complex relationships between symbiote ants and their host trees thus
                produces a selective pressure for more intelligent herbivores than were formerly required to reach the
                same food sources</strong>, ones better able to solve the problem of circumventing the insects'
            defenses. Highly intelligent <strong>rhyncheirid birds</strong>, with big problem-solving brains, thus come
            to monopolize herbivore niches in the broad-leaf forests over their main contemporary competitors, the
            circuagodonts which conversely dominate the grasslands and cool polar forests where insects are far less
            numerous.</p>
        <p><strong>More intelligent feeding strategies, though successful as they are, are not the only way of dealing
                with the defenses of myrmecophyte trees, however.</strong> An equally viable option is physical
            toughness - <strong>the evolution of thick skin or otherwise protective body coverings that prevent insects
                from stinging or biting</strong>. Adaptations of armored snouts have appeared in various bird groups
            since the dawn of the ant forest, proceeding behavioral ant-avoidance adaptations, and remain effective
            though less common in the Ultimocene. Undoubtedly the most extreme example of an armored but slow-witted
            browser is the strange and rarely observed forest giant known as the <strong>lumberbeest</strong>.</p>
        <p>The lumberbeest is the largest living <strong>muck</strong> on Serina, one of the last terrestrial
            representatives of this clade, and the only living member of a family all its own - others like it were
            formerly abundant in the early Pangeacene, but diversity has been in a steady decline since, largely due to
            the evolution of new, more adaptable competitors. <strong>Now found only in the densest, most inaccessible
                regions of the tropics, the last giant is a veritably enormous beast standing upwards of twenty-five
                feet tall and weighing two tons.</strong> It is a creature of marshy woodlands and swamps, where the
            densest jungles are criss-crossed by large silty rivers and broken occasionally by open flood plains. As it
            moves, it walks with a side to side waddle like a giant goose on large splayed toes that spread its weight
            out on muddy earth, its body carried at a forty-five degree angle and its tiny head resting at the end of a
            long curved neck that makes up half of its total height. Though it may feed far from water by night, it
            often spends the day retiring in the rivers or muddy swamps, freeing its squat little legs of supporting its
            hefty body and submerging until only its head peaks out from the water in the reeds along the banks. The
            lumberbeest will travel the wide rivers preferentially to and from feeding sites, swimming with strong kicks
            of its webbed feet and strokes of its large clawed forearms, always floating just under the water with only
            the hump of its back and its head and neck protruding. <strong>Its diet is broad, almost anything green will
                do, and it can afford to eat leisurely from a single tree at a time thanks to its armored skin and
                nictitating membranes that slide over its eyes to guard against even the fiercest ant bites.</strong> It
            lifts its neck high into the canopy, reaching leaves inaccessible to other ground creatures, and feeds
            unperturbed even while hundreds of ants swarm down the branches in defense of their homes and crawl across
            the hide of its face, stabbing their little jaws and stingers against the thick scales futiley and to no
            effect. <strong>They find few orifices to climb into - the lumberbeest can simply seal its ears and nostrils
                as it feeds.</strong> The horny keratin of its short, tortoise-like beak provides no surface to bite,
            and <strong>even the tongue is armored in a thickly protective covering of this keratin. </strong>Countless
            ants stream into the giant's mouth as it swallows and are carried right down the lumberbeest's gullet with
            the vegetation, to no harm to the animal, which simply digests them as well. Very little bothers the
            lumberbeest, for no predator exists that can harm it as an adult. They are mostly solitary but do not oppose
            company, and multiples may gather and feed together from a single tree or bed down in the same pool during
            the day.</p>

                jungle.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p><strong>The lumberbeest's metabolic rate is slow</strong> but even so it must spend most of its waking hours
            feeding. Like most mucks, it also has a poor ability to control its body temperature. Young individuals must
            stay comfortable by environmental means, sunning themselves if they become chilled or seeking shade if they
            are overheating, though adults are large enough to stay warm without much effort and are mostly only
            concerned with keeping cool in very hot weather, which they do by retiring to the water.
            <strong>Nonetheless, the amount of warmth generated by gigantothermy is finite and so the temperature range
                tolerable for the lumberbeest is still thin, restricting them to the tropics where temperatures never
                drop below freezing. </strong> Though they do most of their feeding on land, lumberbeests will also feed
            whilst in the water by extending their necks to graze on waterside vegetation. Occasionally they may even
            submerge completely and graze on algae and water weeds on the bottom of the water just as their distant
            ancestors did. </p>
        <p>To reproduce, the female lumberbeest buries a clutch of eggs in a patch of soft, silty soil in a clearing
            near a riverbank, where the sun will warm them. <strong>She lays upwards of thirty at a time, producing
                three per day for one to two weeks and storing them together in an internal tract</strong>, only
            depositing them when the clutch is complete. She digs out the hole with her long forearm claws that work
            like pick axes to cut into the earth and lays her eggs in layers, between which she fills in the hole with
            soil. <strong>Mucks are noteworthy in that unlike most birds, they have temperature-dependent sex
                determination; each egg laid is sexless, and will only develop into a male or female if conditions are
                right.</strong> In normal conditions, the eggs higher in the nest, exposed more directly to sunlight
            hitting the soil, are kept slightly warmer and mature into males. Eggs lower in the nest, kept cooler,
            mature into females. <strong>This differentiation may serve a purpose in that if nests are raised by
                predators, the eggs containing the less valuable male embryos will be more likely preyed upon than the
                more important female embryos</strong> (as only one surviving male is need to fertilize many females in
            mucks, which have no pair bonding.) The mother lumberbeest provides no further care to her brood once she
            lays her eggs, and their fate is left to luck. </p>
        <p>If all goes well, the eggs hatch several months later into several dozen very precocial infants, more or less
            identical to their parents but much, much smaller - only about one pound each - and also much more agile.
            Just seconds out of the egg, they scurry for cover.<strong> The chicks are on their own from the start and
                are arboreal, climbing into the nearest tree with well-developed claws and grasping talons as soon as
                they leave the soil </strong>to avoid becoming a quick meal to a passing predator. <strong>Their hind
                toes are initially suited to grasp branches and are opposable in a zygodactyl form, which they lose as
                they grow and their feet change into a pillared structure better suited to supporting great
                weight.</strong> They take ten years to reach sexual maturity and as long as thirty years before they
            are done growing, and until the age of six or seven years they will rarely leave the treetops. <strong>While
                almost totally vegetarian in adulthood, excluding the insects they swallow incidentally, the lumberbeest
                starts life with a ravenous appetite for insects and is mostly carnivorous in infancy to allow for the
                rapid growth it must put in to reach its adult size. </strong>Individuals gradually begin to consume
            more plant matter from the age of one year on and are mostly weaned onto a plant-based diet by the time they
            become too large to easily move through the branches, though they will continue to eat small amounts of
            insects, mostly accidentally, throughout their lives. Very young lumberbeests are vulnerable to a number of
            threats including birds of prey and tribbats, while juveniles just coming to ground are often taken by
            grapplers. Mortality is high, and only one in two hundred chicks can usually be expected to reach sexual
            maturity, though if they can get to the point that they are too large even to fall prey to the greater
            grappler, the odds are in their favor that they will experience a long life - a hundred years is not
            unattainable.</p>
