        <h1>Molodonts of the Early Ultimocene: Part 3</h1>
        <p>While some molodonts moved from seeds to insects, another clade of budding carnivores switched their diets to
            the closest thing available in the animal kingdom; <strong>molluscs.</strong></p>
        <p>Most seed-eating molodonts will take snails when they are available; snails are readily found in trees, small
            and hard-shelled like seeds, and full of protein. The molodont jaw is as ideally built to crack them as it
            is to crunch seeds. It is not a surprise therefore that a group of these tribbetheres would early on become
            mollusc specialists by the middle Pangeacene. As their craving for mollusc meat grew, they left the trees to
            forage for their prey on the forest floor, where snails are much more abundant in the shade and shelter of
            logs and leaf litter. But ultimately, it was near water that the most molluscs could be found. And so, over
            just a few million years, the <strong>durophagodonts</strong> ("hard-eating teeth") evolved. </p>
        <p>The earliest durophagodonts were still very recognizable as molodonts, with basal jaw structures and thick
            coats of water-repellent fur. Their feet grew webbed, and they swam with their forearms while using a
            flattened tail primarily to steer, but they were not very derived. A few durophages, such as the
            <strong>spotted snailsmasher</strong>, have remained almost unchanged since, living in freshwater or coastal
            waters across much of southern Serinarcta and still spending considerable time on shore. With a slightly
            upward-curving lower tooth that serves to hold the shells of snails and bivalves, this platypus-like
            molodont then grinds through the shell with the blocky upper tooth exactly the way its ancestors crushed
            nuts, except that it separates out the meat from the shell when the job is done as mollusc shells are
            largely non-nutritive. </p>
        <figure><img src="images/HLmWldQ.png" alt="spotted snailsmasher" /></figure>
        <p><strong>Over a very short time, however, other durophages became increasingly aquatic.</strong> External
            ears, useless underwater, receded into the jaw. Claws shrunk and were lost, losing their role to handle food
            as the mouth alone became enough; they became flippers, poorly suited to move on land, and some individuals
            - especially males without offspring to worry about - stopped coming to land at all. The coat of fur that
            insulated the earliest small species grew thinner from the head backward as insulating body fat now began to
            serve the purpose hair once did. Now seal-like, these forms spread out globally. No longer restricted to
            shallow water, by 25 million years ago they had already become deep divers that could pull shellfish off the
            sea floor - <strong>such a resource allowed an incredible population explosion and then one of evolutionary
                speciation.</strong> Merwals, while still successful, began to find their food harder to find at this
            time. </p>
        <p>Forms like these, the molodont's answer to seals, were widely successful and until comparably recently found
            in all of Serina's oceans and seas. <strong>They formed a grade rather than a proper clade</strong>, because
            the evolution of some was extremely rapid, leaving the closest relatives of some conservative-looking
            species to be <i>much</i> more derived animals.<strong> The change happened incredibly quickly; in under
                five million years some of them became entirely marine</strong>. All hair was lost, fingers were fused
            into fleshy fins, and external ears vanished. They cut all ties to the land, becoming aquatic fish once
            more. </p>
        <p><strong>Over the following ten million years, however, they began to eat themselves to death.</strong>
            Populations rose, then crashed, then rose cyclically as dozens of molluscivorous molodonts stripped the sea
            of its shelled molluscs, organisms that had adapted over millions of years toward fairly minimal predatory
            pressure. <strong>Today, these seal-like forms with large crushing jaws are far from gone, but they are
                fewer in number, victims of their own success.</strong> Forms that remain, such as the
            <strong>clamcracker</strong>, now generally rely on small, fast-maturing sea snails to feed on, while
            species that fed on slower-growing, larger species have died out.</p>
        <figcaption><img src="images/7fZJcaQ.png" alt="clamcracker" /></figcaption>
        <p><strong>Merwals began the sharp decline that continues today at the same time as the sea molodonts numbers
                rose and crashed, unable to adapt to food scarcity by adopting alternative diets.</strong> Many
            durophage molodonts also went extinct late in the Pangeacene as a result of the food scarcity they caused,
            particularly those species that grew large in response to an early abundance of now-extinct giant clams.
            Such clams had never evolved to deal with predation, and were rapidly exterminated; their predators, having
            grown huge to feed on them, could not sustain on anything less and then died out themselves. Yet such
            exceptions aside, <strong>molodonts were much better able to weather these changes of their own doing than
                the merwals</strong>. During periods where mollusc populations were depleted, and merwals starved, some
            durophages found alternatives. Necessity, they say, is the innovator of invention, and some of the fully
            marine molodonts began yet another shift in diet toward new food sources to survive. These were the
            selective pressures that led to the evolution, over the last ten million years, of two particularly
            specialized molodonts, the<strong> reef-eater</strong>, and the <strong>rakewhale</strong>.</p>
        <h2>The Emperor Reef-eater</h2>
        <p>The <strong>emperor reef-eater</strong>, whose name some may contend is overtly descriptive considering it is
            the only species in its genus, is a mid-sized sea molodont, weighing up to eight hundred pounds. Yet once
            you see one, you will understand the regal name it holds: <strong>it is among the most beautiful of any
                tribbethere</strong>, its smooth and hairless skin decorated in beautiful shades of blue, yellow and
            pink and splashed with black spots. But its pretty pelage is only part of its notability; moreso, the
            reef-eater is noteworthy for being an extreme dietary specialist that has survived through periods of
            mollusc scarcity by adapting to exploit the hardest to eat meat in the entire sea; <strong>snail
                reefs.</strong> As bivalves and shelled snail numbers declined in the late Pangeacene, the ancestors of
            the reef-eater, perhaps out of desperation,<strong> turned to chewing on the limestone rock that Serina's
                coral-like reef-building snails produced to shelter themselves across Serina's sunlit shallow seas.
            </strong>Though by collectively building the reef these molluscs produced a stronger, larger shell than any
            other, they were not entirely immune to the powerful crushing jaws of these adaptable tribbetheres which
            soon learned to gnaw at the top of the reef to shatter the stone and suck out the small but incredibly
            numerous fleshy, defenseless snails that hid deep inside. As soon as the ancestors of the reef-eater learned
            of this hidden food source, they adapted rapidly to better access it. <strong>The upper jaw muscles became
                absurdly large</strong>, forming a bulbous bump on the creatures' snout, powering a veritable anvil of a
            tooth with enough force to pulverize the solid rock of the reefs to sand to access the snails inside. The
            result is that the modern reef-eater boasts the strongest bite of any animal ever to evolve - some
            <strong>600 tons </strong>of bite force per square inch measures at the center of the grinding tooth - which
            is enough to shatter solid stone into dust. It is hard work, and the reef-eater feeds nearly continuously
            throughout the day for a relatively small overall amount of calories, but the diet is - at least in the
            short term - reliable; reefs on Serina are immense, covering most coastal shelves, providing a lot of food
            to those few animals crazy enough to specialize on them. </p>
        <figure><img src="images/ik6UJ2R.png" alt="emperor reefeater" /></figure>
        <p><strong>Grazing twelve or more hours a day on solid rock puts tremendous wear on the reef-eater's
                teeth</strong>, but to compensate they have evolved to grow at the astounding rate of nearly <strong>an
                inch per day,</strong> and even then only just break even to maintain their length. In a single year,
            <strong>a reef-eater will crush and digest some five thousand pounds of limestone</strong> from the reef and
            pass it in their waste as a fine white sand that collects on Serina's beaches, like a giant parrotfish.
            Serina's reefs, as expansive as they currently are, can endure a small amount of reef-eater predation. It
            remains to be seen, however, whether they can weather the continued assault of this novel predator in
            conjunction with a cooling climate which will before very long now push their range further and further
            toward the equator. The reef-eater may well eat this food source out of its existence as its ancestors did
            the last - <strong>and this time, there may be no alternative to move to.</strong></p>
        <h2>The Rakewhale</h2>
        <p>The rakewhale is an oxymoron; <strong>a durophage molodont which has abandoned a diet of hard food.</strong>
            As molluscs grew scarce, its ancestors dug around in the sediment for whatever else they could find - worms,
            small crustaceans, even small burrowing fish could be found this way with enough effort. But the molodont
            mouth, for all it can do, was not at first suited well for this, and so to better sift the sediment these
            bottom-feeding forms were under a strong selective pressure to evolve wider, flatter teeth. <strong>The
                teeth began to fuse less neatly in development</strong>, and over time the jaws moved so that they did
            not line up closely to grind together, touching only at the very peak of jaw retraction; the individual
            teeth in the upper jaw plate began to split at the edge of the beak as they grew, <strong>forming a
                rake-like structure that became ideally suited to sift through the sand for hidden prey that the
                creature could then pull into its mouth with a burst of suction.</strong></p>
        <p>Over time this specialized into its modern form; a very wide, flat, comb-like upper tooth swept forward and
            then back through ocean sediments<strong>, pulling hidden invertebrate prey out of the mud and into the
                mouth, like a broom pushing debris into a dust pan.</strong> With this efficient system in place, the
            rakewhale grew larger and only fairly recently colonized the southern sea from the northern. Today found in
            all cool, productive waters worldwide, they have become the largest tribbets ever to exist, <strong>reaching
                up to thirty feet in length and 12,000 lbs.</strong> They are solitary, coming together only to breed,
            <strong>and nearly blind</strong>; frequently feeding below the maximum depths sunlight penetrates, their
            acute senses of smell and touch guide them in dark, murky waters. To find mates, <strong>they produce
                low-pitched pulses of infrasound which carry long distances under the sea.</strong></p>
        <p>With a diet few other animals compete for, which will remain available even as the global climate
            cools,<strong> the rakewhale's immediate future outlook looks bright</strong>, even in a changing world.
            Ultimately, however, it is a very large animal of a specialized anatomy, and its success relies on stability
            that will eventually give way. The rakewhale, for now, remains a successful specialist.<strong> But
                specialists rarely endure for the long haul</strong>, and this has never been more true than in the
            Ultimocene.</p>
