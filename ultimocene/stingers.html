        <h1>The Billion-Stingers</h1>
        <p>The sun is rising in the steamy, verdant jungle of central Serinarcta, initiating the twice a day change of
            shifts between the creatures of the light and those of the night. Male crickets in the tallest branches
            begin to vibrate their wings in unison in hopes of luring in their partners, a handful of isolated buzzes
            and chirps soon forming a chorus and then a roar that carries across the forest. Songbirds -
            <strong>sparrowgulls of all sorts</strong> - begin to stir from their roosts in canopy foliage and, as if
            determined not to be outdone, burst into their own songs. Some whistle sweet melodies, some call with harsh
            cries, but all defend their territories and call in mates as similar birds have done now for hundreds of
            millions of years. The crescendo wakes up little furry <strong>molodonts</strong> which, with wide eyes and
            twitching whiskers, emerge cautiously from tree holes and nests of sticks and twigs in the crotches of the
            trees, scenting the damp morning air for the presence of their enemies before scurrying out onto the vines
            and branches in search of seeds to gather and process with their grinding jaws. Massive
            <strong>tribbats</strong> with brightly colored faces and wingspans seven feet across, having spent the
            night clinging by their tails in flocks have by now also begun to chatter. They beat their leathery wings a
            few times to warm up before flipping right side up and pulling themselves up through the canopy by their
            long wing claws, then clamber as high as they can until the thin shoots begin to bend under their weight.
            Once they can climb no higher, with a sturdy upward push of their tails and flurry of noisy wing beats they
            take flight up above the trees, one after another, toward the fruiting trees which they depend on for food.
            A beetle of some sort, large and colorful and adapted to feed on nectar, alights on a nearby flowering liana
            clinging as an epiphyte to one of the tall forest trees. It's every movement, however, is being tracked, and
            the moment it alights a small but fierce hunter pounces, grabs the prey in its forearms, and stuffs it down
            its gullet. Covered in a layer of fuzzy grey down with half-formed feather quills running down its arms,
            running on its hind legs but clambering for stability with its clawed arms, it is a young <strong>ornimorph
                bird</strong>, caught in an awkward teenage stage somewhere between bird and lizard, though closer to
            bird, minus its lack of remiges. Though still very much flightless, it practices adult behaviors for which
            its young body is not quite capable including flight strokes as it bounds from one branch to another - its
            as yet bare arms meeting hardly any resistance from the air, and in doing so, perhaps mirrors similar
            creatures which lived long, long ago, in how they looked and acted on their much slower ascent into becoming
            birds. For while the the dinosaurs took millions of years to take flight, <strong>the little ornimorph will
                probably do so in just a few months.</strong></p>
        <p>Lower down in the branches, a pair of quadrupedal metamorph birds with flattened, monkey-like faces, big
            alert eyes, wide jaws and tiny beaks scurry along the branches, grabbing small purple fruits in their
            wings-turned-hands and swallowing them whole. They are <strong>placental birds</strong>, metamorphs now only
            by name, not by practice. They are descendants of the <strong>ornkeys</strong>. They have changed very
            little in form from their ancestor and remain at home in the trees. A single fruit drops from a cluster as
            one of the birds reaches toward it with an outstretched palm, and the fruit falls. It bounces off a lower
            branch, startling a basking tribbet of a lizard-like form, which scurries into a crevice in the bark as the
            fruit bounces up and continues its descent to the dark forest floor below.</p>
        <p>The fruit hits the springy rotting leaf litter, rolls a few feet, and comes to rest at the feet of a
            beautiful black and white dappled <strong>circuagodont</strong>, among the most derived of the tribbetheres.
            This one - no larger than a labrador - steps lightly toward the fallen fruit and lowers her head to
            investigate. Her head is shaped typically for her kind - blocky and wide at the cheeks, tapering to a narrow
            edge at the front- but her body is a bit different than others before her. <strong>She is a forest dweller,
                having traded her fastest running abilities for some climbing ability.</strong> She has evolved more
            flexible forelegs that can reach above her head to pull down food and elongated clawed fingers, capable of
            grasping against her palms, in place of hoof-like nails. While she can now climb, though, she is still not
            especially skilled at it and is more comfortable on the forest floor where she is slower than her cursorial
            ancestor but has become adept at diving through thick cover to escape her enemies. Determining the fallen
            fruit edible, she picks it up in her narrow jaws and passes it into the back of her mouth to be pulped. She
            raises her head again and looks around. <strong>Her eyes are bright and alert, her pupils shaped like
                four-pronged stars, adapted simultaneously to watch both the ground and the vertical tree trunks for any
                sign of a lurking predator. </strong>Upon her back, two infants each no larger than a kitten cling
            securely to a tufted mane of hair on her neck, wide-eyed and alert but motionless, <strong>the patterns on
                their own hair blending seamlessly into the markings of their mother. </strong> Living in a less exposed
            and so by some degree safer habitat than their plains-dwelling ancestors, <strong>they do not need to be as
                precocial at birth and will cling to their mother's back with their long front claws for much of the
                next few months. </strong></p>
        <p>The calves are still toothless, <strong>but their mother sports the typical tooth-formed beak of her lineage,
                projecting out of her lips, the upper tooth tapering to a narrow cutting blade that strikes against a
                wider lower plate.</strong> Having finished the fruit - just a supplement to her normal diet - she now
            demonstrates their primary function as she comes to a young sapling tree growing in a sunlit patch in the
            forest gloom. Like most vegetation in the jungle, its nutritious foliage is kept well out of reach of
            grazers on the ground, but she is not perturbed. By turning her head to the side and extending her upper
            tooth forward, she grips the trunk firmly in her jaws. As she pulls the upper tooth backwards, the blade
            slides down and cuts sharply into the bark. A smaller branch would have been lopped off with just one bite,
            but a sapling several inches thick is a bit more resilient. <strong>Without fully releasing her grip, she
                slides her upper jaw forward and then back again in a sawing motion until she clips neatly through the
                trunk, severing the sapling's stem with the efficiency of a set of tree trimmers.</strong> As the
            young's foliage tree collapses alongside her, her infants are startled and raise their heads toward the
            crash, but there is nothing to fear. Their mother sits down upon her haunch, with her tail-leg out to one
            side, and after checking her surroundings one last time, pulls the branches up to her mouth with one of her
            arms and begins to crop the leaves and stems and pull them into the back of her jaws where they will be
            thoroughly chewed before swallowing. As she feeds, her twin offspring venture over her shoulders and cling
            tightly to her chest. They nuzzle her mouth as she eats and begin to squeak plaintively. The mother responds
            by lowering her beak to first one of the begging youngsters, then the other, and for each one
            <strong>unfolding her cheek tissues over the normally exposed tip of her upper beak against the open mouth
                of the infant in a sort of kiss through which she regurgitates the finely chewed pulp of her meal.
            </strong>Unable to feed themselves at all until they grow their teeth, <strong>the infants will depend
                completely upon her to feed them this way for a period of many months.</strong></p>
        <p>When both calves are fed, one returns to her back and nestles in to sleep while mom continues to feed. The
            other steps off of its mother and tries out its own legs for a moment.<strong> It bounds around in the
                leaves of the felled sapling with an unsteady but very eager gait - it is not quite sure on its three
                legs yet, but is very determined to explore despite</strong>. While the baby rolls in the leaves and
            chortles playfully, the mother watches out of the side of her eye, keeping one ear turned toward her infant
            to catch the sound of any approaching predator, while continuing to fill her belly. </p>
        <p><strong>The little calf crawls over and leans against the trunk of a large moss-covered tree</strong> just a
            few meters away to the side from its mother who, busy eating, does not make any move to reign it in. There
            it sits, propped up on its haunch, and picks up a fallen leaf which it sticks in its mouth and moves around
            in its lips as if pretending to eat solid food like a grown-up. It pays no attention to the narrow,
            healed-over split in the old tree's bark which goes several feet up the tree from the ground just behind it,
            and neither does its mother, <strong>until the baby begins to scream.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>The worst danger facing her child is one she could not hear coming.</strong> Frantic at the call of
            her young one's distress, the mother stands and bounds over to her infant, <strong>which is suddenly covered
                in a swarm of stinging red ants half an inch long that are pouring out of the crack in the trunk like a
                flood, crawling through the calf's hair and rushing into its ears, mouth and nose.</strong> She grabs
            her wailing offspring and pulls it away from the trunk but drops it again almost instantly, yelping as the
            growing tide of ants turn upon her now and furiously sting her arms. She frantically shakes and tries to rub
            them off herself, but some of the insects manage to quickly climb up through her fur, stinging her chest and
            neck and threatening to reach her other infant that now squeals out, having also been stung on its nose. The
            first baby squirms helplessly on the ground, its cries muffled as ants fill up its airways, totally engulfed
            in the tide of stinging insects that rises around it like some sort of horrible shape-shifting carnivorous
            mass, which continue to flood out from the tree hollow as the infant stops moving. The mother, driven mad by
            just a few of the insects clinging to her fur, is forced to protect her remaining young and make a hasty
            retreat. </p>

            <figcaption><strong>above:</strong> a mother forest circuagodont is helpless to protect her infant offspring
                from an ambush of the deadly billion stinger ant.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>The ants, <strong>acting as a single overwhelming force, form a writhing, shifting mass of bodies around the
                infant's now still body, almost three feet across and in places several inches deep.</strong> The
            horrible menace is a swarm of <strong>billion-stingers</strong>, a highly aggressive, carnivorous ant which
            lives in nomadic mobile super-colonies millions-strong. Whereas most ants have a stable nest site<strong>,
                billion-stingers are of the army ant type</strong> that has so often evolved among these insects over
            their history and which instead build temporary nightly nests, known as <strong>bivouac</strong>s, by
            linking their own bodies together as a living shelter, then disassembling to hunt by day.
            <strong>Billion-stingers, however, take this habit to a greater extreme than any ants before them</strong>.
            Whereas other army ants break up their living nest and travel with their queens and larvae exposed when on
            the hunt, <strong>billion-stingers maintain a bivouac form even while traveling</strong>, as a percentage of
            the colony remain linked around the reproductive members of the colony to <strong>provide a protected
                shelter for each queen and their developing larvae - and there may be as many as twenty queens in a
                colony, each in its own living nest! </strong> Each "nest" of interconnected bodies may be six inches
            long and wide, <strong>and is supported by several thousand ants of a highly specialized carrying caste -
                workers with elongated bodies and very sturdy legs that grow up to an inch and half in length.
            </strong>The carriers walk on their four hindmost legs while propping up the portion of the colony
            surrounding the queens with their first pair of legs and their abdomens. The line of queens, each secure in
            their own living palace of interlocking workers, travel along the forest floor like a line of caravans on
            the backs of the carriers. They are led and flanked by a large number of the large warrior castes, each
            fitted with vicious hooked jaws for dismembering prey and venomous stings to incapacitate it and fend off
            threats to the queens. </p>
        <p><strong>This colony had been roosting in the tree hollow for the night, and had been roused when the infant
                had come to sit against their resting place. </strong>Swarms of defensive warriors burst from the hollow
            to protect their queens, inciting a flood of attacks that quickly turned predatory. As soon as the
            circuagodont calf has been incapacitated by the warriors venom at the front of the swarm, the entire colony
            descends around its body to feed. Surrounded by the biting, stinging warriors, the carriers pull their
            bivouacs in all around the carcass and another horde of the smaller workers pours out from them.
            <strong>These workers now begin to relay strips of flesh cut from the dead calf by the warriors back into
                the living nests, where additional workers remain to take it and feed it to the queens and larvae.
            </strong>These ants, who never leave their nests, are the<strong> "nannies"</strong> - slightly larger
            workers whose sole jobs are to care for the queens and their young, bringing them meals of meat brought in
            from outside and rearing the larvae directly upon their bodies. <strong>As soon as a queen lays an egg, it
                is gathered and stuck onto the back of a waiting nanny</strong> and stays there until it matures into an
            adult ant. By that time, the nanny may be carrying as many as five other larvae or pupae, adding another as
            each one matures.</p>
        <p>It will only take an hour, maybe ninety minutes, <strong>for the swarm to strip the small infant circuagodont
                down to a clean skeleton,</strong> at which point the workers will all return to the security of the
            bivouacs. The leading warriors will choose a direction and begin marching onward again, followed by the
            carriers and the warriors that line the flanks and bring up the back of the convoy. <strong>Unlike most
                ants, billion-stingers see very well and are not as dependent on scent trails to navigate - rather, they
                can rely on physical landmarks and so travel truly nomadically, often never visiting the same patch of
                forest twice</strong>. If a meal is large, like this, the whole colony will likely seek a sheltered
            place and rest, <strong>but the goal of the billion-stingers is growth, not merely maintenance, and so its
                hunger is rarely satisfied for long.</strong> Often the swarm will feed and immediately set off in
            search of its next prey, which ranges from the smallest insects to large animals unable to escape their army
            in time. </p>
        <p>When actively hunting a variety of different techniques may be utilized by the colony to procure prey -
            <strong>some of the success of the billion-stinger likely lies in its ability to switch between several
                hunting techniques depending on prey species.</strong> When hunting assorted small prey,
            <strong>"coralling" is a favored tactic; in this, the warriors of the colony form a long line outwards from
                the leading edge of the swarm - sometimes up to sixty feet in length - stirring up insects and small
                animals from the leaf litter and then closing in to trap the prey in a ring of vigorously stinging ants
                with nowhere to flee</strong>. If a single animal is a target, such as a molodont or a flightless bird,
            the colony may adapt an ambush technique, <strong>the ants freezing in place until the prey is close enough
                to rush and overwhelm </strong>- if it does not come close enough and goes the other way, the colony
            will return to its usual quicker pace until something else comes along.<strong> Related to the ambush is the
                "flush"</strong>; sometimes used to drive mid-size prey animals into the waiting army, this technique
            involves the splitting of the warrior caste into two groups, one of which waits at the head of the main
            swarm and the other which circles around and attacks an unwary animal from behind, chasing it into the horde
            where it may be overwhelmed with stings.<strong> Very large prey such as adult circuagodonts are targeted
                only opportunistically</strong>, as most animals of this size can readily outrun a swarm and survive
            quite a few stings, but when successful in bringing down such food sources - most often by chance, such as
            when one disturbs a roosting colony - the colony can be sustained for several days at a time. </p>
        <p><strong>Billion-stingers, though not territorial, are highly averse toward other colonies of their species, a
                distinction they make by scent.</strong> Separate colonies rarely outright battle, however, but make a
            strong effort to avoid one another and areas recently traveled by a rival swarm. I<strong>f a single swarm
                is separated, so long as each retains at least a single queen they will part ways as two separate
                colonies</strong>, though individual ants are able to remember the scent of their kin for at least two
            weeks and if reunited in that time the colonies will readily rejoin. Separation is also normal in instances
            where the swarm becomes unsustainable large or in times of food scarcity; <strong>rather than risk
                starvation of some or all of the group, it will splinter into several smaller groups each of which
                migrates in a different direction, improving the odds at least one will find better hunting
                grounds</strong> - made possible because colonies normally have many queens, each of which can continue
            the colony's future.</p>
        <p>The large number of breeding females in a billion-stinger colony is unusual among ants and is directly tied
            to being readily able to split and form new colonies when necessary. This adaptation has had secondary
            effects on their evolution. Rather than producing queens just once annually and having these new breeding
            females fly off to start a new brood, billion-stinger queens periodically produce additional breeding
            females as well as flying fertile males, known as drones, intermittently throughout the year. Males fly away
            but fertile females stay in the colony, breed there, and may never leave at all.<strong> Because they are
                never without the support of a colony, they do not fly at any point in their lives, and so have become
                especially dependent on the care of their subjects.</strong> They have only the tiniest twisted vestiges
            of wings, which break off shortly after pupating, and cannot walk even when newly emerged - their abdomens
            are too fat and their legs too stunted. They mate frequently with flying drones from other colonies - and
            other queens of the same colony too - which fly freely between different swarms, <strong>resulting in much
                higher genetic diversity than other ant colonies</strong> whose members are more often much more closely
            related - often even siblings from a single queen and drone. </p>
        <p>Able to operate as a single cohesive unit with remarkable efficiency, to switch between different plans to
            find prey, and to reproduce simply by splitting apart, without the vulnerable period where queens must start
            a new colony in other species,<strong> the billion-stinger is an extremely successful ant genus common
                across the northern hemisphere 250 million years PE.</strong> A result of the frequent cross-breeding
            between different swarms, they have a high rate of mutation and are highly adaptable. Some species of
            billion-stinger are specialized toward the canopy, many toward the forest, some to the open
            grasslands.<strong> They can cross almost any obstacle, including water, by forming a raft and paddling
                across, and species in temperate climates can hibernate.</strong> Unlike similarly vicious predatory
            ants from Serina's past epochs, particularly those that savaged some of its very first flightless canaries
            in the Hypostecene, <strong>billion-stingers are highly venomous and have very few potential predators, with
                their main limiting factors being the availability of food</strong>; when colonies outstrip the means of
            their habitat to support them, they break apart, and large numbers of ants may starve. <strong>One major
                limiting factor, however, is competition;</strong> the larger a swarm grows, the more unwanted attention
            it attracts in the form of flying insects, birds, and tribbats which flank swarms to snatch up fleeing prey
            in their wake. Once a swarm reaches a certain size, it becomes too obvious to kleptoparasites, becomes
            unable to bring in enough prey to sustain itself, and breaks up and disperses - <strong>thus, even without
                directly preying upon them, the birds and other creatures prevent the billion-stingers from totally
                toppling their ecosystems.</strong> </p>
