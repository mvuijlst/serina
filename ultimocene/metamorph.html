        <h1>Metamorph Birds in the Ultimocene</h1>
        <p><strong>The Ultimocene is a time of change for the changelings, or metamorph birds.</strong> Primitive
            egg-laying groups radiating from the sparrowgulls are experiencing a resurgence and taking back niches lost
            at the end of the Thermocene, pushing them further into ever more aberrant forms. Metamorphs now survive by
            capitalizing on forms, behaviors and niches unattainable to other birds still constrained by the
            hard-shelled egg.</p>
        <p>Most extant metamorphs are derived significantly from their original form, which included a carnivorous
            larval form and flying reproductive adults - though some do still persist, mainly as very small bug-like
            creatures with worm-like offspring that live in carcasses or as parasites of live animals and mature into
            short-lived flying adults which mate, lay eggs, and expire. The rest have adopted niches very different from
            any birds ever before them. <strong>Placental birds</strong>, which experienced a short heyday in the early
            Pangeacene, have secondarily lost their larval stage and the external egg entirely and developed true live
            birth as well as a fully quadrupedal gait. Just one group survives to the Ultimocene, but they are very
            diverse; these are the flightless, cosmopolitan <strong>ornkeys</strong> - arboreal wingless birds similar
            to primates and possums.</p>
        <p>Non-placental changelings comprise several other very divergent lineages. <strong>Archangels</strong>,
            quadrupedal flying birds which lay large soft-shelled eggs and have also lost their larval stage, have
            experienced great success as semi-aquatic waterfowl in addition their original large grazing forms. Instead
            of losing their larval stage, however, other metamorphs <strong>have capitalized on their highly adaptable
                larval forms and evolved to retain juvenile traits into adulthood</strong>, usually through a stunted
            metamorphosis where only some adult traits develop and maturity is reached in a still juvenile condition.
            One such group of these particularly aberrant birds known as the <strong>aquamorphs</strong>, by now
            widespread across the world of birds, long ago evolved swimming, tadpole-shaped larval forms which live and
            feed in water. Though the most basal still retain the ability to morph into a short-lived flying
            reproductive stage, most by now have totally lost any ties to the air. Instead of a full metamorphosis as
            they grow, they develop only a few notable avian traits - some details of the skull, the forearms (which
            become paddles), and the reproductive organs. They retain their gills - formed from the ear canal of the
            neonate - and mature in an aquatic state. <br /><strong><br />Ornimorphs </strong>comprise their own
            distinct branch of the aquamorph clade. The ancestral condition of these animals is a modified variation on
            the original aquamorph life cycle. The small, shell-less eggs are laid in the water in the manner of a frog;
            the eggs hatch into aquatic larvae which grow and feed for anywhere from a few weeks to a few months before
            morphing into a terrestrial form. They differ from their ancestors in that instead of burying themselves in
            the mud and morphing in a cocoon of mucous, like an insect, the process is gradual and occurs while the
            animal is still active and mobile. Legs develop slowly over time, and the larva becomes more terrestrial.
            The larval forms of this group do not develop proper ear gills and retain the primitive skin-driven
            respiration of the earliest changelings, so that as they move onto land their ears develop normally.
            Gradually their skin thickens and their lungs develop along with their limbs so that they are soon fully
            terrestrial quadrupeds superficially resembling the earliest tetrapods. Featherless and unable to regulate
            their own body temperatures yet, they at first hunt on the ground, eventually developing longer legs and
            moving into forests. Here they gradually mature over a longer period, until eventually they climb into the
            canopy and mature as fully-feathered flying birds. Now distinct from the outside only on account of their
            quadrupedal posture, with wings adapted to bear their weight, they fly far and wide. Unlike the fleeting,
            short-lived flying morph of the efts, the ornimorphs have comparably long adult lifespans usually much
            longer than their juvenile stages. They reproduce and scatter their eggs in freshwater pools many times
            throughout this period, and the cycle continues. </p>
        <p>By the Ultimocene, <strong>the ornimorphs have also given rise to another distinct group</strong>, the
            <strong>squaves</strong>, which again <strong>exhibits neoteny by capitalizing on the adaptability of the
                terrestrial life stages and forgoing their maturity into a flighted adult.</strong> Very different from
            most birds, squaves finish their development as quadrupedal lizard-like animals that have also begun to give
            birth to live young rather than lay eggs. Some simply hatch their eggs internally and then release the live
            tadpoles into the water, protecting them from predation while in the egg, but the most successful have taken
            this further by nourishing their young internally via placental ties through the aquatic stage until their
            legs and lungs are fully developed, thus freeing them from a dependency on standing water. They become the
            third live-bearing bird group through a similar series of events to their placental cousins. Their skin is
            thick, holding in water, and protected with small scales like a reptile's. Their forearms also sport
            claw-like projections and they retain a lengthy tail for balance - traits which together lend them a
            lizard-like appearance - but the mouth retains a distinctly avian, toothless beak for grabbing prey and some
            forms still attain a sparse degree of plumage as adults. With a slow metabolism, squaves require less food
            than comparably-sized birds of other groups and compete minimally with most other birds - instead, they
            compare much more closely with <strong>tribtiles</strong>, the reptilian ancestors of tribbetheres which
            have until this time had little other competition. Perhaps due to more efficient quadrupedal versus tripodal
            gaits, they begin to displace tribbets in terrestrial environments, but the tribtiles retain a stronghold in
            the trees. In addition to competing for space and food sources, some representatives of each group adapt to
            prey on the other, as the ecosystem adapts to just another change of countless in the marching scales of
            time. </p>
        <p>A second ornimorph group which exhibits neoteny into adulthood are the <strong>avimanders</strong>. These
            animals mature at an earlier life stage than the squaves - legs develop, but the skin remains permeable and
            the animal tied to the water. Though some do develop a single lung, allowing them to gulp atmospheric to
            breathe and so to survive in stagnant pools, the more derived ones continue to respire through their skin.
            To increase their surface area and therefore the efficiency of the process their skin develops abundant
            hair-like cilia, particularly on the underside, along the arms and around the neck, which function almost as
            gills to passively absorb oxygen from the water column. This allows them to spend their entire lives
            underwater, where some evolve into strange specialist ambush hunters. Grasping onto weedy vegetation with
            their long hind toes and in some cases a prehensile tail, they grasp prey in the mantis-like clawed
            forearms. One such group subsequently adapts to utilize especially small food sources and specializes their
            forearms into brushes of fine hairs used to filter food particles from the water. Unlike the aquamorphs
            which adapted their ear canals into a gill to pump water, all avimanders retain full function of the ear. To
            be most useful at sensing vibration underwater however, the ear drum becomes external, giving these animals
            a frog-like ear visible on the side of the head. </p>
        <p>One group of primitive avimanders becomes too large to rely on skin-based respiration, losing the hair-like
            cilia on their bodies and instead relying on a single well-developed lung. </p>
        <p>The world of birds becomes even stranger in the Ultimocene.</p>
