        <h1>The Ultimate Guide to Metamorph Birds of the Early Ultimocene</h1>
        <p>The world of the Ultimocene is dominated by strange and wild creatures, many of them utterly alien compared
            to their introduced ancestors, but of all the planet's abundant life possibly no creatures are more derived
            than the <strong>changelings</strong>, or <strong>metamorph birds</strong>, which have by this time reached
            their highest degree of diversity ever. Indeed the early Ultimocene could be considered the age of these
            extraordinarily varied animals, which can trace their ancestry all the way back to the Cryocene, 200 million
            years ago, where their long distant ancestors evolved from the <strong>strackbirds</strong> - thrush-sized
            songbirds which lived nomadic lives and associated with large terrestrial carnivores to find food. This
            lifestyle required significant adaptation in order to reproduce, as the parents were always on the move.
            <strong>This resulted in the strackbirds' evolution of increasingly self-reliant offspring that could take
                care of themselves from hatching, albeit in an entirely novel way from any bird before them</strong>.
            They evolved free-living larva-like chicks, fetal birds which hatched very early, with low metabolisms but
            strong jaws that could crawl and feed themselves independently of their parents, a process initially
            facilitated by the parent birds filling a secure tree nest with a larder of fresh meat for the nestling to
            feed on after hatching, by which time the parent would have moved on with its hosts to next again elsewhere.
            <strong>The evolution of a free-living larval form distinctly unique from the adult in habits and habitat
                opened up an enormous degree of opportunity for further specialization</strong> and allowed for their
            survival even through the harshest extinction event the world had ever seen at the end of the Thermocene.
            From this ancestral form, the changelings have by the Ultimocene since diversified incredibly in form and
            function, <strong>with their current descendants ranging in size from a few millimeters to more to tens of
                meters in length, and filling nearly every conceivable niche on land, air, and water.</strong> Today
            comprising as much as 85% of extant bird species, <strong>they are the most successful clade of birds ever
                to evolve on Serina.</strong> With multiple radically different representative groups extant in the
            Ultimocene but most of the ancestral forms with traits that allied them as kin since extinct, their
            alliances are now often difficult to see on the surface, especially as some have lost their larval stage
            completely while others, in reverse, have become completely neotenic and no longer have a distinct adult
            stage at all. With some of the living lineages having been separated from one another by more than 150
            million years of unique evolution<strong>,</strong> the<strong> Metamorphaves </strong>are now
            collectively<strong> also the most ecologically and physically diverse vertebrate clade to ever exist,
            </strong>surpassing even the bony fishes. <strong>They include today both the largest terrestrial birds and
                the smallest birds of any kind ever to exist.</strong></p>
        <p>All metamorph birds of the Ultimocene belong to one of two very diverse clades that are only distantly
            related. From a common ancestor in the Thermocene epoch, <strong>many groups between them have evolved down
                very divergent paths and exploited often opposite strategies to succeed in the game of life.</strong>
        </p>
        <h2>The Incredible Shrinking Birds: The Verminfans</h2>
        <p>The most basal clade of metamorph birds extant in the early Ultimocene are the <strong>verminfans</strong>
            (literally "worm children"], which evolved in the Thermocene era. They are highly variable and include among
            them the most derived of all birds. They are allied by radically different adult and larval niches and
            forms, extensible cloacas that have adapted into ovispositors in the females, by a reduction in the
            complexity of the wing so that it consists only of the primaries, usually between only five and ten of them
            all originating from the manus but in some cases many more, and a tendency for clades to become smaller and
            smaller over time, culminating in the smallest birds ever yet to live. Verminfans engage in complete
            metamorphosis, and their flying adult sizes are usually limited to just a few ounces as a result.</p>
        <p>Among the more primitive lineages of this clade are the <strong>squicks</strong>, including the descendants
            of the Pangeacene fleshborer bird, and the <strong>rootsuckers</strong>, descendant of the ninth-year
            canary, both groups having changed very little since the Thermocene when they split off from one another.
            All of these birds exhibit relatively typical adult forms that are very similar to ancestral perching birds,
            but very specialized, often worm-like larvae. They engage in rapid, dramatic metamorphosis after a period of
            larval feeding that varies from brief to extremely drawn-out. More divergent groups include the the
            pincerwings and the osteopulmas, which sport some of the most extreme anatomical changes of any bird.</p>
        <h3>Squicks</h3>
        <p>Squicks are very small, parasitic or carrion-feeding birds which are no larger than one inch in length as
            adults, <strong>with highly reduced vermiform young that are blind and deaf, that feed on dead or living
                tissue</strong>. Adults are fully developed but short-lived and may or may not feed (when they do, they
            usually feed on blood), and lay their small, very numerous and shelless eggs directly in raw flesh where the
            young hatch and feed in a very similar manner to their ancestors. These larvae respire through their skin
            until adulthood and are highly vulnerable to desiccation outside of a moist carcass or body; they feed and
            grow quickly, then pupate in a ball of hardened mucous into the flying adult form in a span of just a few
            weeks.<strong> In most respects they are the most primitive living metamorph birds, though the adult's wings
                are highly reduced in structure as a result of their extremely small size and support only five primary
                feathers, the least of any flying bird</strong>. Though some larval squicks sport spines or claws on
            their wings in infancy, these are not retained in any of the living species into adulthood. Parasitic adults
            are usually colored cryptically and most often fly by night, where they are less easily detected by their
            host species, while diurnal forms may be brightly colored.</p>
        <figure><img src="images/eCLvHWM.png" alt="herdsbane" />
            <figcaption>The <strong>herdsbane</strong> is a nocturnal, blood-feeding squick that predominately targets
                circuagodonts, alighting upon and biting them in the night when they are less able to defend themselves.
                Its young mature rapidly in carcasses and festering wounds.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <h3>Rootsuckers and Butterbirds</h3>
        <p><strong>Rootsuckers</strong> (with their adult stages known as <strong>butterbirds</strong>),unlike squicks,
            are herbivorous as larvae. Instead of flesh, they feed upon sugars in the roots and tubers of plants in
            forest environments, which they suck with a sharp upper mandible which is adapted to pierce into the tissues
            (the lower mandible is vestigial in the larvae, and absent in the adult altogether), and a long, highly
            flexible tongue which has become a hollow siphoning tube to pull out fluids. <strong>To prevent the beak
                from becoming damaged while the larvae burrows in the soil, it has evolved a very high degree of cranial
                kinesis and a joint at the base that allows it to fold down flat against the chest while
                digging</strong>; this flexion is retained into adulthood, allowing the butterbird to fold down its beak
            when not in use. The larvae are less worm-like than in most of their kin; though blind and with permeable
            skin, they have only a very short tail and are born with fully developed front and hind limbs with which to
            crawl and digs beneath the ground; two of the three large wing claws of the larvae are shed during
            metamorphosis, with the smallest and first digit being retained and used in clinging to surfaces when
            roosting. </p>
        <p>Plant sap is a stable but very low-nutrition food source compared to animal flesh or blood, and so
            rootsuckers may spend many years before they have accumulated enough energy to metamorphosize, very
            similarly to the ninth-year canary of the Thermocene, to which they are convergently evolved but not
            directly descended. Unlike that species, some adult butterbirds are now fairly long-lived not just in
            infancy but also in adulthood<strong>. As a perquisite to survive for many years on a low-calorie diet of
                root sugars, they have developed an extremely fine control over their metabolic rates into adulthood and
                are able to switch back and forth between a high-energy rate and a very low one that allows them to
                survive widely varied conditions throughout the year. </strong>They are able to take advantage of
            abundant flower nectar in the summer in the temperate regions in which they are most abundant, and then to
            hibernate through long, cold winters when food is scarce.<strong> In addition to nectar, adult butterbirds
                consume animal prey by spearing small insects and other metamorph birds with their spear-like
                mandible</strong>, and then inserting the proboscis, which is sharply pointed at its tip, into the body
            and first siphoning out the blood and other bodily fluids and then scraping away the meat inside in thin
            strips which can be passed down through the proboscis. This animal food is gleaned from in and among the
            flowers they feed from, as well as from tree bark, and provides the necessary nutrients for long-term
            survival which are absent in nectar, and the fat and protein necessary for females to produce their eggs.
        </p>
        <p>To avoid competition from other nectivorous animals, including tribbats and other bird groups,
            <strong>butterbirds are frequently nocturnal and marked in subtle earthy patterns that let them blend in
                seamlessly with wood or rocks when roosting during the day.</strong></p>
        <figure><img src="images/OqgCjgV.png" alt="common switchbeak" />
            <figcaption>The <strong>common switchbeak</strong> is a widespread butterbird across the forests of the
                northern hemisphere. It feeds equally on flower nectar and animal prey, including other metamorph birds,
                and by folding its bill tightly down against its chest is able to squeeze itself into the tiniest crags
                to roost during the day, safe from predators or harsh weather.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <h3>Pincerwings and Bumblebirds</h3>
        <p>The <strong>pincerwings</strong> are a clade of verminfans which evolved from the early ancestors of squicks,
            which places them as less derived than the modern representatives of this group so far as when they split
            off the tree of life, though they are more derived in so far as having changed more drastically in form and
            behavior. <strong>As larvae they have adapted their forearms into a second set of jaws which project forward
                and flex on a horizontal plane</strong> and are used in predation. These birds are worm-like and
            primitive as larvae, like those of the squiks, often with long, roughly cylindrical bodies, <strong>but
                unlike the squicks they have become free-living and mobile in the environment, and are active predators
                (albeit very small ones)</strong>, which use their pincers to grasp molluscs, worms and other bird
            larvae and hold them to the mouth to facilitate consumption. As the wings are adapted into pincers, they are
            unusable to pull the body along and so <strong>these birds have adapted an entirely new and novel muscle
                system consisting of an outer ring of longitudinal muscles which stretch, and an underlying band of
                circular muscles which contract</strong>, allowing an earthworm-like squirming locomotion that makes
            them excellent burrowers. Larvae have almost no skeletal elements outside the skull and forearms and most of
            the body is purely supported by muscle. As larvae, they are blind - there is little need to see, as they
            burrow beneath the surface of the soil or in the sediment underwater - and rely on touch and smell to hunt;
            adults, known as <strong>bumblebirds</strong>, are sighted and relatively normal but are clumsy, bumbling
            flyers due to the specializations of their wings which limit the flexibility of the wings to just the
            shoulder joint, effectively producing an insect-like wing which limits their size and maneuverability. The
            wing is so simplified that it has become more energetically efficient for the bird to simply repeatedly
            contract and stretch the paired muscle bands around the torso in order to flex them, <strong>and as adults
                the muscles controlling the pincers actually degrade, with flight occurring entirely by flexion of the
                abdominal muscles. </strong>Larvae are small enough that they still respire via their skin and as such
            can survive in soil or in water, anywhere that is sufficiently moist, while the adults which grow up to an
            inch in length are short-lived and feed on vegetation, fruit, nectar or carrion. Both larvae and adults of
            many species of pincerwing are poisonous as a result of storing toxic compounds from certain insects the
            larvae feed upon, and are brightly marked with warning coloration to advertise their toxicity. </p>
        <figure><img src="images/N3e1QAA.png" alt="varicolored bumblebird" />
            <figcaption>The <strong>varicolored bumblebird</strong> is a diminutive creature of the equatorial
                rainforests, its body scarcely larger than a man's thumbnail; as a larva it feeds upon toxic beetles,
                sequestering deadly toxins in its flesh as an adult, which it advertises in bright warning coloration.
            </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <h3>Osteopulmas</h3>
        <p>Most lineages of verminfan birds diverged tens of millions of years ago, some more than a hundred million.
            There is one group however which only appeared at the very end of the Pangeacene, roughly 245 million years
            PE. Possibly the most derived of all birds, indeed vertebrates ever to evolve, this strange, still young
            clade would be the <strong>osteopulmas</strong>, or <strong>bony-lunged birds </strong>-
            incidentally,<strong> the smallest birds ever.</strong></p>
        <p>The osteopulmas are most closely allied to the pincerwings, with which they share the specialized muscle
            groups as larvae and retain into adulthood, also putting them to use in flight, but their larvae lack the
            adaptation of their forearms into pincers - indeed, they no longer develop forearms as larvae at all - and
            so their wings as adults are less constrained. They exhibit remarkable specialization of their bodies to
            facilitate even smaller sizes than their ancestors - at their smallest, just two centimeters in wingspan -
            <strong>which most notably include having switched from active to almost completely passive
                respiration.</strong> The lungs of the smallest osteopulmas have ossified and become inflexible, and the
            primary means of oxygen absorption in these birds now occurs via an extremely pneumatic skeleton and
            intricately connected air sac system. <strong>The vertebrae on the spinal cord have become hollow tubes
                which just breach the skin on the birds' back and function as spiracles to passively diffuse oxygen into
                and carbon dioxide out of the air sac system</strong>. Oxygen travels down through a system of trachea
            directly into the blood stream. The lungs no longer serve any role in moving air into the respiratory
            system; only minor muscular flexion of air sacs directly beneath the spine provides some pumping of air into
            and out of the system. </p>
        <p>The osteopulmas have also experienced significant changes to their metabolism that set them apart from their
            relatives. They are thus far the only verminfans which are not endothermic in adulthood.<strong> Rather,
                they are poikilotherms; animals with temperatures that vary widely depending on environmental
                conditions. </strong>This means that their energy needs are dramatically reduced, at the cost of being
            forced into torpor in cold conditions. The wing muscles of osteopulmas must reach around one hundred degrees
            Fahrenheit before powered flight is possible; <strong>like insects, these birds can fly at considerably
                lower ambient temperatures, however, by vibrating their abdominal muscles rapidly in order to generate
                this heat only where necessary</strong>. To power their flight strokes, the bird normally rapidly
            contracts one set of muscles which circle the torso while simultaneously stretching an overlying set
            forward, which pulls the wing forward in a flight stroke, and then by reversing both muscle groups which
            pulls the wing backwards and repeats the cycle. In order to warm their muscles, however, the bird rapidly
            stretches its longitudinal muscles both forward and behind the wing simultaneously, resulting in little to
            no wing movement but producing a large amount of heat. </p>
        <p>The plumage of adult osteopulmas is highly reduced among birds; <strong>the primary feathers of the wing are
                much more numerous than in other verminfans(and indeed, any other bird thus far to exist), numbering up
                to seventy per wing - but simplified into little more than barbs which zip together, </strong>almost
            turning the entire wing into a single feather. The body plumage is reduced to tiny, iridescent scales and
            small insulating hairs. They are capable of bearing weight and walking on their wings as a result of their
            diminutive sizes, the only verminfans so able, and the adult has spines along the manus used to grip and to
            climb.</p>
        <p>Their size also means that osteopulmas <strong>are also able to grow extremely quickly and reproduce with a
                shorter generational turnover than any other bird, sometimes just three weeks.</strong> Eggs are laid
            upon a rich food source, often flesh, fermenting fruit or animal droppings, by the female, who has uniquely
            evolved a keratinized ovipositor that remains always extended from the cloaca, allowing her to inject her
            eggs into suitable food sources directly. The maggot-like larvae hatch in just a couple of days and feed
            aggressively, then drop off onto the ground and pupate in a sac of hardened mucous, <strong>emerging in as
                little as ten days fully formed and able to fly and to breed. </strong></p>
        <p>By shrinking into ever smaller and more specialized forms,<strong> the osteopulmas seem set for big
                things</strong>. Originating in the tropical rainforests, in the past ten million years they have
            developed an almost cosmopolitan distribution. </p>

            <figcaption>The <strong>zebra tweezle</strong>, no bigger than a honeybee, is perhaps the archetypal
                osteopulman bird, exceedingly small, bizarrely derived, and with similar forms found worldwide; it feeds
                on overripe fruit, feces, and carrion. </figcaption>

        <h2>Onto Bigger Things: The Ambuloptera</h2>
        <p>Only slightly less basal than the verminfans, the second major clade of metamorph birds are the
            <strong>ambuloptera</strong> (walking-wings), or <strong>quadruped birds</strong>, which split off from the
            verminfans very early, and are descended from the first metamorph birds to evolve truly free-living larval
            stages which began adapting to more varied diets than carcasses, and which became free-living in the forest
            floor. Though less successful by number of species, they comprise the most morphologically diverse clade of
            all the metamorph birds, which is extremely varied in form, niche, size and behavior. Most broadly, they are
            distinguished from the verminfans by more developed larval stages, born with open eyes and able to move more
            freely in the environment to forage for food. <strong>In the Thermocene era, while the ancestors of
                verminfans were becoming more worm-like, the ancestors of the ambulopterans redeveloped long-lost
                musculature in their forearms in the larval stage, allowing them to go from merely pulling the body
                forward to actively bearing weight</strong>, adaptation made possible by their neoteny and the still
            very malleable nature of their anatomy at this early stage of development. These changes greatly improved
            their freedom of movement over their competitors by allowing them to walk and not merely crawl worm-like on
            their bellies, and forever changed their path of evolution.</p>
        <p>From this ancestral form, the ambulopterans gave rise to many distinct descendant groups, <strong>each of
                them capitalizing on their own strategies and adaptations to follow very different paths over
                evolutionary time.</strong></p>
        <h3>Into the Water</h3>
        <p><strong>All ambulopteran larvae normally show a progression of complexity as they mature.</strong> Like
            verminfan larvae, they are born with very thin, moist, and permeable skin through which they respire, but as
            most groups grow their lungs develop within a few weeks and become their primary source of respiration.
            Early species would have laid their amphibian-like eggs in damp leaf litter to prevent them from
            dehydrating, and when the eggs would hatch, the larvae would scurry away and fend for themselves there until
            they were larger and more tolerant of the drier conditions above the forest floor, when they would
            metamorphosize in a similarly rapid and complete manner to the verminfans. <strong>These early forms did not
                develop lungs until adulthood, and were thus similarly constrained to small adult sizes, as the larvae
                had to stay small to effectively respire.</strong> </p>
        <p><strong>It was not a far jump for the adult birds to actively begin laying their eggs in freshwater to ensure
                they stayed moist, though, and it was in this way that some ambulopteran larvae became semi-aquatic.
            </strong>Very young birds, able to absorb all their necessary oxygen through their skin, could breathe
            underwater and indeed, their method of absorbing oxygen worked more effectively there. Not only were able to
            exploit food resources unavailable to other metamorph birds at the time, but they could grow far larger
            before metamorphosing. <strong>The development of their walking forelimbs was delayed, and instead at first
                they now developed long embryonic tails</strong>, which propelled their round, fat bodies through the
            water like tadpoles. Before the Thermocene-Pangeacene boundary, a new clade had developed; the
            <strong>aquamorph birds</strong>, defined by their obligately aquatic larvae. Only when several weeks to
            months of age, when they were often quite large, did their lungs then become active and their hind- and
            forelegs develop into more than vestigial nubs, and they began to move out of the water. </p>
        <p>From this stage, three distinct clades subsequently diverged which can be seen today; the
            <strong>gilltails</strong>, the <strong>ornimorphs</strong>, and the <strong>eargills</strong>.</p>
        <h3>Gilltails </h3>
        <p>The gilltails are the most basal aquamorphs. The larvae of this group often grow relatively large, up to 14
            inches in length, and have had to evolve a more efficient respiration system than the skin alone to support
            life at this scale. <strong>Their solution was to utilize the the fleshy locomotory tail,which has become
                lined with small fleshy protuberances, each lined with folded, hair-like cillia which are densely packed
                with hemoglobin and which pulse to pass water through the tail, forming a gill - </strong>thus their
            common name, and allowing them to survive underwater at larger sizes than skin-based respiration alone
            allows.<strong> Larval gilltails, in common with other aquamorphs, are active and highly mobile versus
                verminfan larvae, resembling salamanders or newts, and hatch with well-developed eyes and acute visual
                acuity made possible by relatively larger eggs.</strong> They are omnivorous and feed on algae, detritus
            and any small animals that they can snap up; their beaks are reduced to little more than a horny covering
            around the jaw, even in the adult, which is carnivorous and feeds on insects and small animals found near
            water, by swallowing them whole. Larvae initially have only a tail and no limbs, but within weeks will have
            developed both fore and hind legs used to grip the stems of water plants and clamber through water
            vegetation. Adults retain the two digits of the wrist and bear two small wing claws put to the same use in
            clinging to reeds. Metamorphosis is complete, and occurs when the larvae forms a cocoon of mucous and buries
            itself in the mud near the shore of its pond or stream habitat.</p>
        <figure><img src="images/DkWp7ph.png" alt="tufted frogjar" />
            <figcaption>The <strong>tufted frogjar</strong> of the northern marshes is a typical gilltailed bird, with
                an aquatic, newt-like larval stage which is much larger than the small, generalized bird it grows into,
                due to the re-absorption of the tail which occurs in metamorphosis.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <h3>Ornimorphs</h3>
        <p>Ornimorphs are the second most basal clade of aquamorph changelings. They begin life the same as gilltails,
            as limbless, tadpole-like creatures which breathe through their skin until they become too large for this to
            still suffice for their needs. Evolution has come up with its own solution to this crisis, however, and in
            their case, their lungs develop and they become air-breathing very early, long before maturity - uniquely
            among their fellows, their larvae do not have any sort of gill at all. By breathing air, ornimorph larvae
            thus too lost their restriction of size.</p>
        <p>The larvae of ornimorphs could therefore grow even larger than those of gilltails, sometimes to twenty four
            inches or more - tens of times the size of any of their terrestrial relatives, and well beyond most of the
            normal predators of changeling larvae. They faced a new issue now, however, and that was that by becoming so
            large in their youth that their final metamorphosis into the adult, flying life stage would take much, much
            longer. When the time came to change, the young would have to hole themselves up somewhere safe, sometimes
            for months as they produced their mucous cocoon and went into a state of torpor as their bodies changed and
            transformed into feathered, winged creatures at last. The process was risky, and many would be found by
            predators in this lengthy and defenseless state, <strong>which is why a few initially mutant larvae that
                didn't respond to the hormonal cues of their kin and go into torpor to transform, but which rather
                remained active and matured more gradually while awake and feeding, quickly gained the competitive
                advantage. </strong></p>
        <p><strong>Maturation in these birds became more prolonged than in their ancestors</strong>, but in exchange,
            they did not have to sit vulnerable for months in a cocoon to reach maturity. Now instead, they grew and
            changed gradually over months to years, transitioning first from an aquatic, then to a terrestrial and
            finally to a winged, warm-blooded and normally long-lived adult stage. By the early Pangeacene, this new
            clade known as the ornimorphs were widespread. Notable for symbolically re-living their own distant ancestry
            with each generation - from a fish-like larval stage, a reptile-like juvenile which becomes increasingly
            arboreal, and finally a feathered adult that takes flight from the treetops and into the open sky - these
            birds are now common across the world in the Ultimocene. <strong>Able to spawn in water, adults of most
                species have become the most airborne of any life forms, and may never touch ground again after their
                maiden flight at sexual maturity. </strong></p>
        <figure><img src="images/MfIFzKy.jpg" alt="shadowskimmer" />
            <figcaption>
                <p>The <strong>shadowskimmer</strong>, a very primitive ornimorph that has an air-breathing aquatic
                    larval stage but which never evolved a terrestrial intermediate, is also the largest species. With a
                    wingspan that can reach up to thirty feet, they are specialized skim-feeders of the open sea, where
                    they surf along just above the surf and snap up small fish and other prey in their narrow, elongated
                    bills under cover of darkness when such prey rise near to the surface from the depths to feed on
                    plankton. Hunting at night and resting on the wing at high altitude by day, it sports unusual
                    reversed countershading, with a black belly to blend in with the night sky and a white dorsal side,
                    to reflect excessive solar heat during the day. It is so highly adapted toward an airborne existence
                    that it has no hind legs at all; in an emergency, it can roost and take off from the surface of the
                    sea by its powerful wings alone, though it will never touch down intentionally once mature, spending
                    its entire adult life in the sky. </p>
                <p>Only a very small percentage of individuals reach maximum size and reproductive age; the skimmer's
                    life as a flying creature begins modestly. The shadowskimmer is one of the last ornimorphs that
                    still retains some semblance of a cocoon, and the predatory aquatic larvae spin one in the thick
                    reeds at the edge of a stream from which they emerge several weeks later as a small, fully-formed
                    bird. The juveniles, no larger than swallows, emerge from the water in large flocks and feed in a
                    similar manner to the adults for several years in freshwater before, if they survive these first
                    perilous seasons, heading out to sea once their wingspans reach five feet.
            </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p><strong>All early ornimorphs were relatively large birds, but competition with sparrowgulls gradually
                encouraged the evolution of smaller and more specialized species</strong> throughout the later
            Pangeacene. Their larval and juvenile stages are now often highly specialized, allowing them to avoid
            competition with other birds, and in a reversal of natural selection, smaller adult sizes mean they can
            develop through their various juvenile stages more quickly. </p>
        <figure><img src="images/CmbKvxw.png" alt="spectacled puddlebrood" />
            <figcaption>
                <p>The <strong>spectacled puddlebrood</strong> is a derived ornimorph. Unlike the shadowskimmer, its
                    development is clearly demarcated into distinct specialized stages,beginning with an aquatic tadpole
                    and progressing through an amphibian, reptile, and dinosaur-like life stage before becoming a
                    flighted bird. </p>
                <p> This species reproduces by laying its eggs in the water-holding leaf axils of nanboo trees, from
                    which the larvae eventually sprout legs and emerge in the form of frog-like creatures that feed on
                    ants, sequestering poisonous chemicals in their tissues that protect them from predators. Over
                    several months, the growing juveniles become larger and more explicitly arboreal, with their bright
                    warning colors fading into camouflaging stripes as their diet changes to a more generalized
                    insectivore's and their innate toxins diminish. With their metabolic rate still slow, they are now
                    ambush predators; their tongues by now have elongated and are used to snap up prey until, finally,
                    they near their adulthood and develop a more active metabolism and can capture insects actively and
                    the tongue reduces. They now scurry up higher into the trees and will, over the next few months,
                    becoming first leapers, then gliders, and finally take flight over the forest canopy and transition
                    completely to a diet of agile flying insects which they hawk down with great agility. As adults,
                    they will land only to lay their eggs in the small leaf-born pools of water in which the cycle will
                    begin again.</p>
            </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Additionally, some ornimorphs have experienced even greater adaptability by prolonging their metamorphosis
            indefinitely; <strong>some clades are neotenic, and reproduce in a more primitive juvenile state without
                reaching the final flying adult form.</strong> They were not the only aquamorph clade to do so...</p>
        <h3>Eargills</h3>
        <p>The eargills are the most derived aquamorph changelings. <strong>Rather than evolve new ways to facilitate
                their eventual metamorphosis, during the Thermocene they capitalized on neoteny </strong>and gave rise
            to <strong>permanently larval species</strong> which were able to become sexually mature without ever
            transitioning out of their larval forms at all. To facilitate respiration as <i>they</i> became too large to
            efficiently breathe via their whole skin alone, <strong>they evolved an entirely new respiratory organ - a
                true gill - by channeling water through their mouths and out of their ear canals,</strong> where the
            skin specialized into a matrix of convoluted folds with a large amount of surface area, which were extremely
            efficient at absorbing oxygen directly into the blood stream. To facilitate this, their ear drums became
            permanently ruptured, and their ability to hear became reduced to sensing vibrations in the water column via
            the bones of their jaws. Eargills, so freed from the need to leave the water to breed and with this
            efficient manner of respiring, rapidly diversified from the ancestral tadpole form into various fish-like
            creatures, some flawlessly hydrodynamic and others elongated and eel-shaped, and <strong>spread across
                global waters as the first completely and utterly aquatic birds, independent not only of land, but of
                air.</strong> With their ties to the sky severed completely, they could grow enormously large -
            <strong>the largest eargilled changelings now grow to tens of meters in length.</strong></p>
        <figure><img src="images/uWYtQyk.png" alt="pikebirds" />
            <figcaption><strong>Pikebirds</strong>, such as this species, are widespread freshwater predators in
                northern freshwater systems and prey upon anything they can swallow whole.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Yet the tie to the sky was not cut in entirety by the eargills. <strong>One more primitive branch still
                survives which still retains an adult form</strong>; they are the <strong>dayflight birds</strong>, all
            of which live only long enough to disperse away from one body of water and lay eggs in another, making them
            vernal pool specialists, especially in arid regions. </p>
        <figure><img src="images/qybzXmF.png" alt="cannibal dayflights" />
            <figcaption>Though most dayflight birds survive in vernal pool habitats by eating algae, detritus or small
                invertebrates, the largest pools support their own endemic predators. <strong>Cannibal
                    dayflights</strong>, their larvae larger and more aggressive than the others that share their pools,
                eat almost exclusively other dayflight larvae. The adults are highly sexually dimorphic, allowing them
                to easily find each other and mate in their brief lives which, though longer than most dayflights due to
                their richer larval diets and higher energy stores, still last just a couple of days.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Though all dayflight genera are capable of metamorphosis into a flying adult, this does not mean all do so
            regularly. Some species are able to be aquatic through their entire lives, reproducing in the larval form as
            in other eargills, and doing so for generations. Yet even in these apparently flightless, neotenic species
            and population remain hidden latent genes which hold secrets until they are needed again. <strong>Dormant
                genetic pathways can be expressed through certain environmental triggers to induce the ancestral
                metamorphosis</strong>. Known as <strong>efts</strong>, these creatures spend most of their lives as
            "fish" in freshwater ponds and pools, but if these pools seem destined to dry out are triggered to lay eggs
            which will hatch into smaller, fast-growing larvae which then metamorphose into a winged dispersal stage -
            <strong>birds</strong> - which can save the population by searching out a new source of water, breeding and
            then laying another clutch of eggs. If conditions are good and oxygen levels high in the new pool, these
            will grow into another fully aquatic generation, but if they are poor will mature into a second generation
            of dispersing flyers who will hopefully have better luck finding a stable water source. <strong>Some eargill
                populations produce efts almost annually </strong>and have specialized to make use of short-lived vernal
            pool habitats which dry up after a few months,<strong> but most can go years, sometimes decades and possibly
                centuries before a particularly dry year results in an incredible migration of flyers which set out in
                search of greener pastures</strong> - or rather, wetter ones. Because these species have specialized to
            live in water, and retain these flighted life stages only as a last-measure unit of dispersal,
            <strong>eargills which enter the eft stage do not develop into completely functional birds. </strong>They
            lack stomachs, their mouths may be partly or totally sealed, and they are deaf as a result of the
            transformation of the ear canal into the gill of the aquatic form. They rely on energy gained in their brief
            larval stage to power their migrations, and fly until they find water, or die trying.</p>
        <figure><img src="images/o207GuM.png" alt="giant eft" />
            <figcaption>The <strong>giant eft</strong> is a common eargilled bird of southern rivers and lakes. Most
                populations are totally neotenic and do not morph, yet in the driest plains regions, where pools
                sometimes threaten to dry up completely in summer droughts, the efts still retain the ability to spawn a
                population-saving flying dispersal generation that escapes to find a new, wetter home to lay their eggs.

        </figure>
        <h2>A Loss of Larvae</h2>
        <p>The evolution of a larval life stage is what defines the metamorph birds. The verminfans capitalized on this,
            allowing the young and adults to specialize more than would ever otherwise be possible into different
            ecological niches. But for some members of the ambulopterans, <strong>the larval stage eventually became
                seemingly no longer of any benefit at all, and was subsequently lost altogether.</strong></p>
        <h3>Placental Birds</h3>
        <p>Following the Thermocene-Pangeacene extinction event, one group of early ambulopteran birds rapidly speciated
            in the resulting evolutionary vacuum in the opposite way of the aquamorphs. Their evolution based around the
            further specialization and adaptation of their weight-bearing forelegs for locomotory and manipulatory
            purposes. Such an adaptation, evolving first purely to facilitate more freedom of movement in the young life
            stages carried no loss of fitness if retained into adulthood and indeed conferred a fitness gain, allowing
            the adult bird to grow to larger size than was ever possible as a biped whilst still retaining freedom of
            flight by allowing for a powerful quadrupedal launch in the manner of the pterosaurs. Having a larval stage
            at all was, for some, no longer necessary, and <strong>one clade of ambulopterans subsequently lost it
                completely.</strong> The <strong>placental birds </strong> did this by retaining their very small eggs
            internally and having them hatch and develop through a simplified larval stage in the womb, attaching to the
            uterine lining and sharing a flow of nutrients with the mother until being born alive and very highly
            developed, often at a very large size, which required or at least strongly selected for a loss of flight
            abilities altogether.</p>
        <figure><img src="images/tVAfPle.jpg" alt="blue-throated boomsinger" />
            <figcaption>The <strong>blue-throated boomsinger</strong> of south Serinarcta is one of the largest birds
                ever to walk the land, weighing over fifteen tons and standing up to fifty feet tall. It is one of the
                last serezelles, which survived the evolution of more efficiently-feeding circuagodont herbivores by
                growing to enormous sizes and utilizing food resources out of their reach. Boomsingers are so named for
                their otherwordly, resonating songs which can be heard for miles, and even further as infrasound through
                the ground, letting herds communicate over vast differences. Boomsingers are so large as to be virtually
                gigantothermic, and have lost almost all of their feathers save for sparse plumes on the face. The young
                are born extremely large - already hundreds of pounds at birth - and are cared for by the herd for a
                very prolonged period.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <h3>Perditacunaves: Archangels and Kin</h3>
        <p>The <strong>perditacunaves</strong> ("birds of lost childhood"), with less specialized wings and retained
            powers of flight, were more constrained to reduce their weight and so did not retain their young as long.
            <strong>The embryos initially attach to the uterine lining by their tails, but detach before full growth is
                completed </strong>and spin an especially thick, sturdy mucal cocoon while still within the mother.
            <strong>This cocoon has evolved into a new, second egg, which is then laid and develops further for another
                few weeks to months outside the mother's body. </strong>This egg is different from the ancestral egg in
            being soft-shelled, rubbery and less calcified, but serves the same purpose. Unlike most birds before them,
            they are also buried in the earth rather than incubated by the parent. Instead of a true yolk, the larvae
            absorb their tails for energy as they finish development;<strong> as the tail is no longer utilized for any
                other purpose, it has swollen into nothing more than a bag of fat and nutrients upon which the
                developing chick relies until fully developed</strong>, ready to pierce the egg's shell and hatch into
            the world.</p>
        <p><strong>Perditacunaves retain the slower metabolism of larval metamorph birds in their embryonic
                stage,</strong> which allows them to develop slowly but steadily at lower temperatures than would have
            been possible for the ancestral warm-blooded bird. These birds' eggs are large and equipped with massive
            stores of energy that are not fully absorbed until just before hatching, when the vestiges provide a quick
            source of energy to kickstart the chick's metabolism; <strong>in just a few minutes, the hatchling's body
                warms rapidly to an endothermic condition, and it is able to take flight and begin foraging for food for
                itself.</strong> Some birds of this clade are known for the ability to reduce their metabolisms back to
            an embryonic level when necessary to conserve energy, <strong>allowing certain species to hibernate and
                enter torpor in conditions of low food availability. </strong></p>

            <figcaption>The <strong>glidegander</strong> is a typical basal archangel. With a 25 foot wingspan, these
                highly social grazing birds still migrate across the southern plains in search of tender new grasses in
                the early Ultimocene, as their ancestors have now done for tens of millions of years.</figcaption>

        <p>Together the ambulopteran birds comprise the majority of terrestrial megafaunal birds on Serina today.
            Placental birds are flightless animals which have lost their wings entirely in order to adopt their front
            limbs into dexterous arms or weight-bearing limbs, <strong>allowing them to grow larger than any land-living
                birds before them.</strong> Perditacunaves are almost all flying animals, but they are often larger than
            the majority of their winged competitors, sparrowgulls and tribbats, and notable in that while usually
            strong flyers, they spend much or even most of their time on the ground or on water and find their food
            there, using flight only for dispersal and long-distance travel. <strong>A far cry from their tiny
                beginnings, today they include among them the largest flying animals ever to exist.</strong></p>
        <figure><img src="images/OgLulUL.jpg" alt="stormsonor" />
            <figcaption>The <strong> Stormsonor,</strong> a highly migratory giant archangel which feeds on the
                Serinaustran tundra in summer and in tropical floodplains by winter, is the largest bird ever to fly on
                Serina. With a wingspan of fifty feet and a height of up to thirty at the head, these 1,000 lb
                leviathans are larger than some air craft but are gentle giants, feeding on water plants and
                crustaceans. They are named for their eerie, rolling calls in flight, which are heard long before they
                are seen flying in flocks high overhead, and their tendency to appear after seasonal storms which bring
                flooding and encourage the growth of the organisms they sustain upon. </figcaption>

        <h2>In Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Between the ambuloptera and the verminfans, <strong>the early Ultimocene is truly the age of the metamorph
                bird.</strong> Not since the hypostecene, and the introduction of the first canaries to Serina, has one
            animal clade seen such incredible and widespread success. No matter what the future will bring, the
            incredibly varied and adaptable metamorph birds will, in one form or another, be ready to exploit any
            opportunity life offers for some time yet to come. </p>
