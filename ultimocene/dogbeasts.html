        <h1>Canitheres: Dogbeasts of the Ultimocene</h1>
        <p>We begin our overview of Ultimocene tribbetheres with the most morphologically underived clade: the
            <strong>canitheres</strong>, which are sometimes also known - by the literal translation of their scientific
            name - as <strong>dogbeasts</strong>. <strong>While canitheres as a clade also encompasses the mertribs and
                their own descendant forms, the merwals</strong>, for purposes of conciseness we will exclude them to
            their own chapter and<strong> treat the canitheres from this point forward as paraphyletic, referring only
                to the terrestrial representatives unless otherwise stated.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Canitheres have changed relatively little in 67 million years</strong>, when the first cursorial
            predator tribbetheres evolved in the immediate aftermath of the Thermocene-Pangeacene boundary. This first
            form, ancestral to all other tribbetheres, were adapted with strong legs for pursuit hunting and jaws lined
            with sharp teeth to kill prey animals - traits still present in the modern canitheres, whose clade proper
            diverged from other tribbetheres about 60 million years ago. Modern canitheres however are distinct in a few
            respects from their earlier ancestors. <strong>Only two clades of terrestrial canithere has survived to the
                Ultimocene</strong>; the <strong>repandors</strong>, a group that has extremely specialized toward
            endurance running, and the <strong>barognatheres</strong>, now reduced to <strong>a single aberrant
                species.</strong> </p>
        <h2>Barognatheres</h2>
        <p>Barognatheres, clade Barognatheria (heavy jawed beasts), once ruled this land. Dog-like canitheres of a
            primitive form<strong>, they were the first canitheres and diverged as a clade more than 60 million years
                ago</strong>. They spread across the face of the supercontinent in the Pangeacene, hunted serezelles and
            the first circuagodonts with strong crushing jaws and were, for a time, virtually cosmopolitan across Serina
            save for its islands. <strong>Yet their reign was short-lived, and their downfall demonstrates the principle
                of the competitive forces between clades that drives evolution.</strong> Predatory circuagodonts which
            evolved tens of millions of years later, from a more derived branch of tribbetheres with higher cognitive
            abilities, more developed social structures and jaws even better adapted for hunting megafauna, were a nail
            in their coffin. They began to move over the landmass within the past 20 million years, <strong>generally
                driving off and displacing the solitary canitheres wherever they met.</strong> Form and function that
            suited the barognatheres for tens of millions of years proved inadequate to compete with new, stronger and
            smarter rivals, and over twenty million years virtually this entire group of once seemingly indomitable
            predators dwindled, their lines of descent terminated anticlimactically, not from disaster but simple
            inefficiency. <strong>They were all, one by one, beat at their own game.</strong> </p>
        <p><strong>Except for one</strong>.</p>
        <p>Today <strong>a single species of barognothere holds out in the deepest depths of Serinarcta's central
                tropical rainforests</strong>, an environment no other canithere has ever infiltrated. To survive for so
            long, it has had to substantially change away from its ancestral form and behavior <strong>- something few
                other canitheres managed.</strong> Once adapted to hunt on the open grasslands this once lanky hunter
            <strong>has grown squat and small of stature</strong>, only about twenty inches at the shoulder and three
            feet long, with short and stubby legs -<strong> a form of naturally inherited dwarfism that has proven
                beneficial at letting it run below the dense tangles of forest vegetation in pursuit of its
                prey.</strong> Its ears have shrunk as well, likely so that they do not snag, while its head is
            proportionally massive, supporting a huge jaw filled with sharp teeth. Known as the
            <strong>brushbounder</strong>, it is today the only canithere capable of - indeed, well adapted to - hunting
            and killing animals of its own size or larger: <strong>sometimes several times larger, as it is also the
                only species that has ever evolved to hunt in cohesive, cooperative packs. </strong></p>
        <p>Like their ancestors,<strong> brushbounders are endurance hunters</strong>, and one of the only such
            predators that is able to operate in dense vegetation, thereby circumventing its preys' natural desire to
            seek out cover and hide. Packs are usually formed of young relatives - only very rarely unrelated young
            adults that meet after leaving their mothers' packs at maturity - and consist of up to ten adults though
            usually just four or five. They hunt with highly efficient cooperation to bring down a wide variety of prey
            species, birds and tribbetheres alike. Smaller prey is driven by several individuals to a waiting ambush by
            the others, while larger prey are simply overwhelmed and brought to ground by the powerful clamping jaws,
            <strong>which have traded ancestral flexibility for brute strength. </strong> Blade-like teeth in the rear
            of the mouth slice together when feeding, <strong>allowing the animal to chew its food before
                swallowing.</strong></p>
        <p>The dark, spotted coat of the brushbounder blends effortlessly into the shaded forest floor where sunlight
            only hits the ground in small dappled patches, which allows these predators to stalk close to their prey
            before launching their pursuit, often catching it with little chase. <strong>When necessary, however, they
                may pursue their prey for as far as a mile through seemingly impenetrable undergrowth </strong>until it
            either is caught up in the branches, tires, or finds safety in a clearing where most creatures can then
            outrun the short-legged pursuer.</p>
        <figure><img src="images/tYJTdj3.png" alt="brushbounder<" />
            <figcaption>Short-legged and stocky, the brushbounder is the most basal living canithere, the last
                aberrant branch of a once worldwide, widely successful clade of strong-jawed megafaunal hunters
                since outcompeted by predator circuagodonts. Small herbivorous circuagodonts, meanwhile, are common
                prey (lower left.)</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Brushbounder packs are stable for life and are always segregated by sex, </strong>with males grouping
            together and females likewise. Males are larger, and as a rule their packs smaller, <strong>sometimes just
                consisting of bonded pairs.</strong> Females weigh about one third less than males<strong> but their
                packs are large, tending toward more than five animals,</strong> and as a result females are more
            aggressive at establishing and maintaining a dominance hierarchy which is formed initially on size and
            strength but is often stable for years even as lower ranking individuals may grow larger than the more
            dominant ones. <strong>Male and female packs do not share territories and are hostile toward one another
                outside of breeding</strong>, when the females reproductive cycles sync and they become restless and
            seek out a group of males to mate.<strong> All females in a pack will pair and may become pregnant at
                once</strong>, and in bountiful times the pack will cooperatively rear the entire litter, all of whom
            are usually related to some degree as their mothers are either siblings or cousins.<strong> If food is
                limited, though, the dominant female will kill and cannibalize pups down the line of dominance as they
                are born</strong>, beginning with those of the lowest ranking female and ending with the mother just
            below her, demonstrating an impressive cognitive ability to remember a very large number of individuals
            inherited social ranking. If conditions are unsuited to even a single litter, she will terminate even her
            own offspring if providing for them will threaten the health of the pack's adults, though this is very rare.
        </p>
        <p>Generally, once pups are one to two weeks old and their eyes begin to open and they become more mobile around
            the den site, they are safe from infanticide. <strong>Open eyes in the young triggers stronger parental
                reflexes and appear to inhibit any culling behaviors</strong>. If all litters survive, the pack may
            raise upwards of fifteen pups at a time which remain fully dependent on their mothers for at least six
            months and rarely leave the natal group before ten. Eventually though all young do leave -<strong>
                brushbounder clans are almost never multi-generational, and young must leave to make room for the next
                year's broods. </strong>Sisters or cousins born and raised in a pack typically stay together for life
            while males split into smaller sub-groups; occasionally single young adults will be accepted into an
            unrelated group, and likewise <strong>old adults whose packs have died off may be accepted into groups of
                young, providing a sort of mentor role as experienced hunters. </strong></p>
        <p>The complex social structure which has gradually evolved in the brushbounder<strong> has gone hand and hand
                with increased intelligence, </strong>requiring selection for abilities like cooperation, problem
            solving and memory, and this species is very likely the smartest of all canitheres. Whether this, or their
            unusual form and habitat - or both - is the primary factor in their success versus the rest of their clade
            is uncertain. <strong>What is apparent is that this species has defied all the odds and remains a success
                story even in this rapidly changing world.</strong></p>
        <h3>Repandors</h3>
        <p>The repandors, clade Repandorsatheria, are the more derived and currently more specious canithere group on
            Serina, which comprise four genera. Their clade name (literally <strong>"upward-curving-backed
                beast</strong>") accounts for their extraordinarily flexible backs which curve dramatically during
            locomotion, <strong>serving as a spring to store and release energy and allow for rapid movement over land
                in pursuit of prey.</strong></p>
        <figure><img src="images/v9YrWif.png" alt="painted repandor" />
            <figcaption>The painted repandor is the widest-spread canithere on land in the early Ultimocene. It is a
                grassland predator found across central Serinarcta. and preys primarily on the smallest of
                circuagodonts, known as smeerps.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p><strong>While repandors have specialized further toward high speed and so have considerably longer legs and
                leaner bodies than the first tribbetheres, they are the nonetheless fairly primitive</strong>. Indeed,
            the wider canithere clade [including its aquatic derivatives] is the only one among tribbetheria which has
            remained almost entirely carnivorous and the extant terrestrial representatives, despite their
            specializations, still retain the least divergent ancestral traits of all their clade. <strong>The
                extensible jaw typical of basal tribbetheres is present in all canitheres</strong>, but while the first
            species of the Pangeacene and their single modern representative had powerfully built crushing jaws and were
            capable of preying on relatively large animals, the modern repandors have moved away from this toward a
            precise snapping jaw well-suited to snatch up smaller vertebrate prey.<strong> This is a direct example of
                ecological niche partitioning</strong> which began to occur as a younger tribbethere clade - the
            circuagodonts - <strong>displaced both the stronger carnivorous canitheres which formerly hunted the flocks
                of serezelles and other placental birds, and much of these former prey species themselves</strong>,
            toward the end of the Pangeacene. </p>
        <p>In addition to their more flexible spines, thinner build, and elongated limbs, the repandors are distinct
            from their predecessors in having evolved lengthier,<strong> narrower snapping jaws adapted to grasp, hold,
                and render into small portions whole vertebrate prey in a manner unique among land predators</strong>.
            When the jaw is closed and retracted this gives them an even more canine profile, with a long face like a
            collie, an impression furthered by the large, mobile ears which express emotion. As the jaws open up though
            the impression breaks down rapidly as the jaws expand first outward, then forward like a shark's, with the
            lower jaw in particular projecting down and ahead to grasp small fleeing prey and snap it against the
            needle-like fang teeth on the upper jaw. The bite force at the front of the jaws is not powerful, and though
            it holds the prey securely it rarely kills it outright. Instead, the final blow is delivered by the more
            powerful back of the mouth as the jaws retract back into place. While more basal canitheres could chew by
            shearing their rear molars together, the repandor uses this to kill. As the jaw retracts, the prey is pulled
            back into the mouth and between <strong>six razor-like slicing teeth in the rear of both jaws which then
                occlude together in a shearing motion</strong>, cutting the victim apart into several smaller portions
            that are then easily swallowed. </p>
        <figure><img alt="repandor biting" src="images/oxjGZpA.gif" />
            <figcaption>As a repandor bites, its jaws extend first outward, then forward in a grasping motion. As the
                jaws
                retract, blade teeth in the back of the mouth clip together to chew the prey into manageable morsels.
                This jaw extension is a hallmark of tribbetheres, which inherited it from their ancient fish
                ancestors.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>While predatory circuagodonts have replaced canitheres as top predators in their environments
            worldwide,<strong> the repandors have found a new place in the ecosystem. </strong>Today about fifteen
            species eke out a successful living as <strong>mesopredators</strong>, most of them primarily
            <strong>feeding on molodonts and small circuagodonts</strong>, Serina's ecological equivalents to field mice
            and hares, and to a lesser extent on the remaining small ground birds that are fewer now than at any time in
            Serina's history. Repandors are widespread across both major landmasses in the early Ultimocene, having
            diverged around the time the inland sea began rising to split the super-continent, and primarily dwell in
            open grasslands or savannahs with sparse intermittent woodlands where they have room to run down their prey
            in the open before it can find cover. </p>
        <p>The typical repandor is relatively large - 3 to 4 feet at the shoulder - but very gracile, with a very lanky
            build and so is quite lightweight and delicate. <strong>Unable to fight larger carnivores, they rely on
                their superior agility to avoid confrontations. </strong>Though physically incapable of hunting prey
            close to or above their own weight class by limitations of their weak jaws, <strong>they do scavenge the
                carcasses killed by larger predators when the opportunity is available</strong>, rushing in, shearing a
            mouthful of meat and bolting away before the rightful owner can drive them off. There are a few small
            species, more in line with foxes than dogs, one of which dwells on the fringes of the southern desert and
            eats a diet high in insects (the chihuahua-sized <strong>foxtrotter.</strong>). Adapted to extremes of heat,
            the latter has the largest proportional ears of all canitheres, which it uses to cool itself. </p>
        <figure><img src="images/02GOTPT.png" alt="foxtrotter" />
            <figcaption>
                Weighing only six pounds and barely knee-high, the little foxtrotter is a nocturnal desert
                specialist that feeds mainly upon insects. Large ears help to dissipate heat, while its wide eyes
                provide keen night vision. Its toes are long and covered with thick bristle-like hair, which
                simultaneously distributes their weight widely over loose sand so that they do not sink, and protects
                the paw pads from scorching ground temperatures.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>While their ancestors dabbled in social hunting 30 million years ago, mobbing large prey as a group to bring
            it down, <strong>the smaller prey size that the repandors have since evolved to capture has made such social
                hunting with others of their kind largely unnecessary</strong>, for each kill is now often just enough
            for a single individual, and so these animals would likely be expected to be largely solitary and
            territorial. <strong>There is one situation where cooperation can bring benefits, however, and this is
                child-rearing</strong>; multiple adults can more easily provide for their young than a single mother,
            and <strong>the repandors are actually monogamous, pair-bonding animals</strong>. Thus, unexpectedly, these
            solitary hunters are actually social when off the clock. Pairs often mate for life, hunting separately by
            day (or, for some species, by night) but sharing a territory and returning to a common den site to rest.
            Allogrooming, where one partner cleans the other's skin or fur with the tongue and teeth, is a common
            gesture of affection and also serves to remove parasites from places one cannot groom easily on itself, such
            as the back and neck. <strong>Both parents cooperate equally to hunt and provide regurgitated food for the
                young</strong>, which are born in litters of two to six and stay in a secure burrow for about a month
            before leaving the nest, and with their parents for another few months before independence. To demonstrate
            his competence as a provider young males also often provide food to prospective mates as a courtship
            gesture, as well as to their bonded females while the mothers are brooding the young pups which cannot
            maintain their own body temperatures for at least two weeks after birth<strong>. As in all tribbetheres,
                food is transferred from parent to offspring, or partner to mate by locking their lips</strong>, after
            which the receiver produces a suction to pull pre-chewed food out of the provider's mouth. </p>
