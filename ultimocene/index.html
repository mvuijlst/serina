        <h1>The Ultimocene: Beyond 250 million years</h1>
        <p><strong>As the single connected super continent of the Pangeacene officially breaks in two for the first
                time</strong> 243 million years PE, the Pangeacene reaches its conclusion, giving way to the
            <strong>Ultimocene.</strong></p>
        <p>As we come to the Ultimocene, we are faced with an important question which was not, before, so relevant. How
            might life on Serina end?</p>
        <p>For this evolutionary thought experiment, the end will be a cold one. Serina is a small world of
            indeterminate age, meaning that as time wears on - like all celestial bodies - it has been slowly losing
            heat. For our scenario, this cooling begins to reach noticeable levels around this time. The Ultimocene will
            be defined by the <strong>gradual extinction of Serina's volcanism </strong>as a result of the cooling of
            Serina's mantle. The extinction of volcanism will be a slow and irregular process, resulting in many
            alternating periods of glaciation when volcanism is minimal or absent and a resurgence of a warmer climate
            and rapid sea level rise during brief periods of renewed volcanic activity<strong>, but as the Ultimocene
                progresses, glacial periods will last longer and reprieves be fewer and further between.</strong> As the
            mantle cools, tectonic movement slows and finally stops. The subduction of the plates under the mantle will
            eventually halt, and new land will cease to be made. The continents will start to erode, and without any
            volcanic activity, Serina will eventually be overtaken by an ice age to which there will be no end.
            <strong>The end of the Ultimocene will be the end of life on Serina. </strong> </p>
        <p>But that time has not come yet. The Ultimocene will cover the most biodiverse period in Serina's history and
            chronicle the remainder of Serina's habitable lifespan. It will further be divided into three acts - namely
            the early, mid, and late Ultimocene, all of which will demonstrate different conditions for the planet's
            life to adapt to. <strong>The early Ultimocene will serve as the finale for the world of birds, as plant and
                animal life reaches levels of derivity unlike anything before, while the middle Ultimocene will be a
                time of great change, and the late a final show of tenacity for the world's ultimate survivors.
            </strong>Serina's final epoch will begin mildly, as a sort of second Thermocene - warm, wet and ideal for
            life of all kinds - but as it progresses, the era will experience several dramatic changes of climate which
            will force rapid adaptation - or extinction - of life.<strong> Long periods of stability will become a thing
                of the distant past as Serina approaches the end of its habitable period. </strong></p>
