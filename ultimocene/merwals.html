        <h1>Merwals of the Early Ultimocene</h1>
        <p>By the early Pangeacene 228 million years hence, shortly after the canitheres first diverged among the
            tribbethere clade, one early branch had already begun a new evolutionary path and returned to the ocean as a
            semi-aquatic predator. Lured from coastal scavenging into finding food in the water itself, <strong>the
                mertribs became the first tribbetheres to return to the ocean</strong> - the home of their earliest
            ancestors.</p>
        <p>It may seem strange for a terrestrial fish such as any tribbet to return to the water tens of millions of
            years after leaving it<strong>, yet such is not unusual among living things if one were to still consider
                seals, whales, and even sea birds to still be lobe-finned fishes </strong>- as they remain, by descent,
            no matter how much evolution may change them. Oceanic environments are highly productive, Serina's shallow
            waters in particular, and can support a wide variety of often wholly unrelated animal groups, though only
            <strong>so long as they are able to niche partition to avoid the direct competition of the same particular
                resources.</strong> Alas, this is not always the case.</p>
        <p><strong>Mertribs may still be extant by the Ultimocene, but only just.</strong> Initially spreading widely
            over the oceans across the Pangeacene, dozens of species went extinct by the end of that epoch. <strong>The
                reasons for their rapid rise and equally rapid decline seem to be linked to competitive
                exclusion</strong>; the first mertribs fed on fish, but appear to have been pushed from this diet by
            much more nimble dolfinches and other aquatic bumblets and toward a later specialization upon shellfish
            feeding. Replacing long, extensible jaws of sharp teeth with less flexible mouths adapted to engulf mollusc
            shells and pulverize them with crushing molars, they became more specialized<strong>. In nature
                specialization is a double-edged sword</strong>; it can bring relief from competition with generalists
            to adapt to exploit a more difficult to access resource, yet the more specialized an animal becomes for one
            diet the less it will later be able to handle changes to its environment that may limit this resource as
            well. Sadly, this is the case with the mertribs - <strong>an unfortunate double-whammy of direct dietary
                competition, first with birds and later, other tribbetheres</strong> - but that is a subject for another
            page.</p>
        <p>In the last 27 million years the diversity of mertribs has fallen sharply to truly dire straights, and the
            living species belong to just one fairly modern clade. Though very few in number, the forms that remain
            belong to a clade quite derived. Known as <strong>merwals</strong>, these canitheres have become entirely
            marine, cutting all ties to the land, and are <strong>the last of the mertribs. </strong></p>
        <p>We meet the merwals for the first and last time in this chapter, for today there are left just about
            <strong>half a dozen species of them</strong>, all fairly closely related and members of the most recent
            derivation event within the last 10 million years.<strong> Even a few thousand years ago we might have seen
                an additional four or five species, a few tens of thousands more and perhaps as many as ten more. Now,
                though, their days are numbered.</strong></p>
        <p>These last of the mertribs only slightly resemble their ancestors, retaining a mermaid-like manner of
            swimming with their single hind leg has become once again a fluked tail, though now pulsing horizontally and
            retaining its ankle joint versus the vertical ray-finned tail of their earliest Serinan ancestor. The body
            of all merwals is more streamlined, devoid of fur, and the front paws have lost their dexterity and become
            rounded flippers, and adults are more streamlined than the young, <strong>whose bodies have less fat and
                show more clearly the joints still present in their hind legs</strong>. The external ears are very
            small, though not yet lost to time - indeed, they will not get the chance to lose them. The jaw is long and
            extremely strong, with cone-like teeth at the front used to grip and pluck shellfish from the ocean floor
            and large square molars in the back of the jaw used to crack them open.<strong> The extensible jaws of the
                canithere have become nutcrackers, stretching wide to accommodate the very large bivalve molluscs they
                feed upon</strong> - organisms that returned to the sea from the last freshwater refugia at the end of
            the Thermocene and reclaimed much of their former diversity during the Pangeacene. </p>
        <p>Resembling crook-backed dolphins, the last remaining merwal species are scattered at low densities around the
            southern coasts of Serinaustra where their food sources, which include clams, snails, and occasional
            crustaceans - can still be abundantly found. They combine an enigmatic mix of traits; they are dietary
            specialists yet highly intelligent, the smartest of all canitheres, with complex lasting social groups and
            cooperative parental care, and they take many years to mature. <strong>Their young are able to swim with
                their mothers from the moment of birth and are born with a full mouth of teeth</strong>, which lets them
            feed themselves on whole food offered to them by the adults in their social groups. </p>
        <p>The last few merwal species are different colors and different sizes, and coexist via slightly different
            diets. The largest, the ringnecked merwal, grows 11 to 14 feet in length and feeds on very large bivalves
            and almost nothing else, while other species may preferentially eat crustaceans or weaker shelled molluscs
            like small snails. </p>

        </figure>
        <p>Yet their complex behavior has not saved them from their anatomy; their form is ultimately inefficient -
            <strong>the joints in their hind leg limit their speed in the water versus either fish or aquatic
                birds,</strong> propelled by a non-jointed tail or by several flippers, which gradually pushed them out
            of piscivory and toward slower food sources. <strong>For several million years the merwals found success in
                a diet of hard-shelled, little-exploited food resources</strong>; they diversified, they crossed the
            seas... and<strong> yet today nearly all of that is gone.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Merwals, so newly evolved as they are, are already going extinct.</strong> It will be less than 5,000
            years before the last of them is gone from the Serinan seas. And it is all because of the existence of
            another, very different clade of tribbetheres. Better swimmers, just as social and intelligent, and with an
            unstoppably efficient set of teeth even better suited to feed on hard-shelled foods... By the early
            Ultimocene, that most derived group of all tribbetheres - and the next group we will visit on our
            exploration - the <strong>molodonts</strong>, have colonized the sea... and just about everywhere else upon
            Serina. And as they spread, the many varied forms of these frighteningly efficient toothy-jawed creatures,
            the most successful of all tribbets, will alter the ecology of their entire world forever.</p>
        <p>Merwals were conceptualized by my pal <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/mynameisnotdave23" rel="nofollow"
                target="_blank">mynameisnotdave23</a> , who did this fine fanart piece (shown with a dolfinch!) and
            inspired me to canonize his clade as the last of the mertribs after they were originally going to be
            entirely extinct by this time. This species is the bearded merwal, <em>Icthyphocus barbops</em>, (the
            bearded-faced seal fish), and it is also extant at the time of writing. I imagine it is a somewhat smaller
            species, and likely more basal. It has many long whiskers used to help locate prey in the sediment and
            lending its common name.</p>
