        <h1>Tribbats of the Ultimocene</h1>
        <p>Descending from ancestors once very similar to the first canitheres, some 75 million years ago in the
            aftermath of the Thermocene-Pangeacene boundary <strong>a very unique tribbethere clade began to diverge.
            </strong>Over tens of millions of years their long legs shortened. Their arms grew muscular, while their
            fingers elongated to grasp and cling as they left the ground in search of prey that fled the ground for
            safety in the trees. They became smaller, more nimble and better suited to weave through the foliage, first
            climbing and then leaping through the trees. They hunted small vertebrates, then flying insects.
            <strong>Membranes of skin formed between their wide spread fingers, forming a sort of net that they cast
                over their prey to pin them against tree bark</strong> - and over time, they found use in these webbed
            hands<strong> to slow their descent when dropping down upon their prey from a height</strong>. A flight
            stroke developed from the prey-grabbing motor pattern, as their fingers became longer still and the webbed
            membrane provided lift, letting them cross further and farther distances in their leaps to catch their
            food<strong>. On the hind limb the central toe receded and became vestigial whilst the secondary digits
                rotated to become opposable so that the creatures could roost by clinging upside down in the trees,
                cutting their ties with the ground further. Countless accumulative small adaptations</strong>, each
            building on its predecessor, slowly turned paws into hands into wings... until at last sometime around 40
            million years ago the<strong> tribbats</strong> leapt from the trees, spread their arms... and <strong>took
                flight</strong>, the first new vertebrate group on Serina to evolve powered flight in its history.</p>
        <p><strong>But the first tribbats were weak flyers.</strong> Their wings were short and broad and served only
            enough to flutter them between short distances in the trees to catch their insect prey, and their long
            grasping tails trailed behind them awkwardly. They were, however, good climbers and spent the majority of
            their time in the jungle canopy where they found an abundance of food. Their wings now took up five of their
            seven digits on the forearms and grew off of a long spur on the wrist that allowed them to be easily folded
            up behind the arms when not needed while the two free claws remained strong to provide a grip on the
            branches<strong>. Yet as they became competent climbers they became less and less adept at walking</strong>
            - and ever more ungainly on the ground. This in conjunction with only minimal flight ability - hampered at
            first by heavy bones and awkward, bulky wings unsuited to prolonged flight -<strong> the tribbats remained
                relatively restricted in range for tens of millions of years to the tropical forests</strong>, where
            their expansion was limited by the presence of dense crowned forest within which they could travel. </p>
        <p><strong>Primitive tribbets in the Pangeacene nonetheless explored several diets</strong>, expanding from meat
            toward fruit and from there to leaves and shoots, with some species growing large and bulky and almost fully
            flightless again to accommodation the large stomach necessary to process such food. Certain relatives of
            these arboreal herbivores adapted from there on to a very different diet; <strong>they started feeding upon
                the abundant ants' nests that were almost as numerous in Serina's jungle trees as leaves</strong>. The
            huge stomachs reduced in complexity as a diet of ants provided many more calories for almost no additional
            effort - they filled almost every tree like fruit lying just beneath the bark - and even their stomach acids
            dwindled for disuse, as ants came with their own formic acid to break themselves down in the gut once
            crushed by the jaws. Thick skin underneath a plush coat of hair protected them from most bites and
            stings.<strong> Their extensible jaws became sturdy and they gradually evolved a strong bite force at the
                distal tip of their jaws </strong>rather than the back of the mouth as in canitheres; large, blunt
            incisor teeth became hammers to smash against ants nests underneath bolls in tree bark, after which the jaws
            retract. A tongue as long as the animal's whole body is then slid between a groove in the upper teeth and
            licks up the nest's contents, particularly the fat-rich larvae. Aptly named <strong>barkbiters</strong>,
            several such ant-eating specialists across two genera are now found across central Serinarcta, <strong>all
                of which are now almost entirely secondarily flightless</strong>; too heavy for sustained movement in
            the air, the most they can accomplish are a few labored flaps from a high branch to a low one - scarcely
            more than a controlled drop. </p>
        <figure><img src="images/tR24gSf.png" alt="mottled barkbiter" />
            <figcaption>a mottled barkbiter bites open an ant's nest in a rainforest tree before licking up the ants and
                larvae inside; it feeds quickly, for it will take only moments for other cooperative colonies in the
                tree to be alerted and come to the aid of the damaged nest, at which point the troublesome tribbat must
                launch off with what remain of its stumpy wings and clumsily fumble into an adjacent tree where it
                begins the sequence again. <strong>Almost all of its waking hours consist of biting open nests, feeding
                    before the ants become too aggressive and moving on</strong>, traveling upwind so that the ant trees
                cannot warn one another of its approach with distress pheromones. Because it can rarely feed for more
                than 30 seconds at a time, <strong>each nest usually survives and can repair the damaged nest structure
                    with fragments bark and adhesive saliva in a matter of hours</strong>. </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>While such early evolutionary experiments have found some success in the Ultimocene, it was the tribbats
            which didn't radically alter their initial diets, those which remained carnivores, which would ultimately go
            on to bigger things. Only the selective forces forged by the arms race to catch ever more nimble, agile prey
            would eventually favor the right combinations of adaptations necessary for strong, sustained flight and
            allow the tribbats to at last<strong> break free of their ancestral tether to the forest and colonize the
                world. </strong></p>
        <p>The first tribbat wing structure was a membrane connecting the five flight fingers to the abdomen extending
            down most of the tail almost to the toes and supported from the elbow and the ankle by rods of cartilage.
            This formed a wide, bulky, but stable wing at substantial cost to agility and flexibility. In order to adopt
            faster and more controlled flight would require limiting the extent of the wing membrane so that the hind
            leg could be pulled under the body and reduce drag. Only ten million years ago did a tribbat species
            overcome the original constraint of their wing shape, and<strong> through a single chance mutation formed a
                clade that would go on to change the trajectory of tribbat evolution forever</strong> with a sudden
            <strong>mutation that split the wing into effectively two membranes</strong>; the wings, which now attached
            higher up on the leg or even on the body and were supported primarily by the cartilage rod growing from the
            elbow, and a tail membrane formed by skin stretched between two now-free-standing cartilage rods that
            formerly gave strength to the rear of the wings. <strong>The narrower wing shape provided much greater
                maneuverability in the air, while the tail - now freed from the wings - could fold under the body in
                flight to reduce drag, with the tail fin extended to assist in turns and landing. </strong>These forms
            could fly much more swiftly through vegetation as well as turn faster in the air in pursuit of prey animals.
            The more advantageous wing shape opened up new niches as active predators, and as strong flight became more
            advantageous increased selective pressures developed toward the evolution of more powerful breast muscles
            and an enlarged keel on the breastbone on which to anchor them. <strong>The result was a full transformation
                of the tribbat from a clumsy tree-bound climber into a fast and powerful predator of the skies</strong>,
            and allowed them begin to expand their ranges outward from the densely vegetated tropics to the more open
            temperate forests and beyond; they colonized all manner of new habitats and spread across virtually the
            entire world, save the most isolated islands, by the start of the Ultimocene. From that first mutant tribbat
            ten million years ago the clade has now exploded exponentially in diversity to more than 500 species. Today
            these free-winged tribbats with tail fins already make up approximately <strong>three out of every five
                species</strong> on Serina despite having existed for only a fraction as long as earlier families, and
            virtually all of those that occur outside the northern rainforest belong to this more derived clade. These
            are the <strong>Dividoptera</strong>, or <strong>split-winged tribbats.</strong></p>
        <h2>Dividopterans</h2>
        <p>Dividopteran tribbats evolved as predators, but the diets of these winged hunters can range from<strong> tiny
                flying insects up to birds and even vertebrates as large as circuagodonts.</strong> Their freely-moving
            wings and folding tail fans give them high maneuverability equaling that of flying birds and at small sizes
            their wing, formed from the entire hand, is even more flexible and thus energy efficient in the air.
            <strong>A good indicator of a clade's adaptability and its prognosis for lasting evolutionary success is how
                widely varied its members are in body size,</strong> and in this respect the dividopterans do very well,
            <strong>ranging from less than one-tenth of an ounce to more than ten pounds.</strong></p>
        <p>Some of the largest dividopteran tribbats of the early Ultimocene are members of the subclade
            <strong>Volanvenators</strong> (flying hunters). This is the oldest subclade of split-winged tribbats,
            comprising 120 species, and <strong>is the group from which all other dividopterans descend, making it
                paraphyletic</strong> for our intents and purposes here. Highly agile flying carnivores that are active
            by day and hunt via excellent eyesight, they swoop down on their victims on the wing and snatch them up with
            their projectile slinging jaws. Their mouths operate similarly to those of the canitheres, designed to grasp
            while extended and hold prey tightly between the teeth when retracted, but they lack the chewing mechanism
            and swallow their food whole in gobbets torn with the incisors. Originating in forests where their narrow
            wings let them soar and weave through brush and obstacles with ease, this is the home of the largest of all
            flying tribbats, the<strong> aeracuda</strong>: ten to twelve pounds of heavy muscle, with a vicious toothed
            jaw and a six foot wingspan.</p>
        <figure><img src="images/lW5NEqQ.png" alt="aeracuda" />
            <figcaption>the aeracuda, pictured preying upon a small placental bird, is the heaviest dividopteran. It is
                a large flying predator with a fierce set of teeth that kills its prey on the wing but which has also
                adapted to walk quickly and efficiently over the ground better than any tribbat before it.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p><strong>The aeracuda is a highly effective solitary predator which feeds entirely on warm-blooded vertebrates
                up to two times its own body weight.</strong> It hunts open forests across both southern Serinarcta and
            northern Serinaustra, spotting for prey from a hidden perch in a tree with its keen eyesight that picks up
            any sign of movement. When a placental bird, a molodont or even a small circuagodont appears in its its
            sights, it pulls in its wings and dives in pursuit. It turns and drops, rises and falls in the air to
            narrowly miss branches and tree trunks without missing a beat, all the while keeping its gaze locked on its
            target. <strong>Faster in the air than anything can run, jump or climb on the forest floor or in the
                branches, the chase is a deadly race whose winner is usually determined only by whether the prey can
                take cover before the aeracuda catches up.</strong> If the victim finds shelter in a burrow, a hollow
            tree, or a dense thicket at ground level then the aeracuda pulls back - it will not attempt to dig out a
            meal or go face to face with a defensive set of jaws. No, the aeracuda wants a clean kill. It wants to trail
            its prey, close its long fanged jaws on the back of the neck as it still runs, and knock it down from
            behind, keeping the jaws well away from its own face as the victim's brief struggle dwindles and the life
            leaves the body. If the prey is small, it may simply hoist it off the ground and carry it to a tree perch to
            feed, but if large it simply cuts into the abdomen with its serrated knife-like incisors, and feeds there on
            the spot. <strong>It opens first a small wound through which its narrow pointed jaws can reach in to remove
                first the choicest organ meats.</strong> Later as the initial wound is expanded, its wider cheek teeth
            will shear the muscle from the sinew and bone<strong> so that when the predator has filled its stomach
                little more than a hollow pelt - a literal bag of bones - lies on the forest floor.
            </strong><strong>After a large meal the aeracuda is often too loaded with meat to take flight</strong>, but
            this is not a problem. With a sturdy first finger adapted to bear weight and wings that support the body
            nearly vertically on the ground,<strong> the aeracuda is the best adapted to walk on solid ground of all
                tribbats</strong>, and merely strides to the nearest tree and reaches up with the wing claws to climb up
            and rest laying upon a branch - it has become too heavy to hang upside down by its tail alone. </p>
        <p><strong>Territorial by nature, the aeracuda comes together only seasonally to breed, and does not form
                enduring social bonds</strong>; as in most tribbats, the male and female partake equally in their care
            of the offspring which are nurtured in a nest of sticks secure in the crotch of a tall forest tree. For the
            first month the young, born in broods of two to four, are helpless, blind and deaf and dependent on having
            one parents in the nest at all times to provide warmth and protection, but afterwards maturity is rapid. By
            six weeks the pup can fly and by two months of age it is largely independent. <strong>Independence and
                flight ability greatly precede maturity, and the pup grows for up to three years following its
                independence</strong>, during which time it hunts first insects and small birds and gradually progresses
            to larger prey. meanwhile,<strong> the quick maturity of the pups allows the parents to rear several broods
                per year.</strong></p>
        <p class="asterism">&#8258;</p>
        <p>Other volanvenators have moved out of the forest entirely and adapted to feed on totally novel prey. One such
            species is the <strong>tribbfisher</strong>, a tern-like tribbat that has specialized to use its extensible
            jaw to catch fish and other aquatic prey from the surface of water. Unlike the aeracuda, this species is
            social to the point of gregariousness and lives and breeds in flocks hundreds strong, hunting out on the
            shallow ocean waters, inland waterways and coastal tributaries and roosting on sheltered sandbars or islets
            offshore. With a very wide range covering all of the inland sea between the two major landmasses as well as
            adjacent rivers, several subspecies as well as related forms exist, all of which are similar in behavior and
            distinguished primarily by markings. </p>
        <p>The tribbfisher has experienced success even competing among seabirds at least partly because it has evolved
            specialized eyesight that blocks horizontally polarized light, meaning that it does not perceive the glare
            of sunlight on water as do most animals, including humans. Instead, thanks to a series of microscopic,
            vertical lines of dark pigment on the surface of the lens of the eye that filter out the vast majority of
            this horizontally-oriented reflected light from reaching the iris, the surface of the water appears as a
            clear window even under direct sunlight conditions. Indeed, due to their superior eyesight, seabirds will
            often follow tribbfishers to find shoals of fish obscured by reflections on the water that they would
            otherwise be likely to pass by. </p>
        <figure><img src="images/ZS2iQKk.png" alt="tribbfisher" />
            <figcaption>
                <p>Light in weight but wide of wing, the agile tribbfisher is a very social piscivore that lives in
                    large flocks and hunts swimming animals just below the surface, using its protracted jaws like
                    tweezers to pluck out unwary prey which is then swallowed whole.
            </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p><strong>Tribbfishers are a unique case of a tribbat that no longer perches in trees, but which has also not
                adapted well to walk on the ground,</strong> despite breeding on open sandy beaches. As all of their
            hunting is done on the wing and they shelter on islands free of ground predators, they have had little
            reason to evolve an upright gait or stronger weight-bearing digits like the aeracuda. Instead, when landing
            the tribbfisher simply lowers its tail and then falls onto its wrists with its wings splayed to the sides
            and crawls almost on its belly. <strong>Parents alternate guarding a single pup, with one always brooding
                over it to provide protection from flying predators, and many pairs rear their young in close contact
                for group defense. </strong>As in the aerocuda the young matures quickly and reaches independence before
            being fully grown, allowing the parents multiple annual breeding opportunities.<strong> Social year round,
                tribbfishers are very affectionate with one another and engage in frequent social grooming and physical
                contact with others</strong> - and not only their mates. They are not socially monogamous for more than
            one season, nor are they sexually monogamous at all. <strong>Extra-pair copulation is the norm and bonded
                pairs exist only to ensure the survival of the young, though very rarely does a male raise only his own
                offspring. </strong>individuals may even switch partners between broods in a single year. While this may
            seem inefficient it ultimately maintains peace and improves the reproductive success of all individuals in
            the colony, as no male can be sure that another pairs' offspring are not his own. <strong>This prevents
                infanticide</strong>, which could otherwise occur in scuffles over limited nest sites, and <strong>may
                also result in unpaired or even unrelated males lingering around the colony and assisting in feeding the
                chicks of pairs who have lost one or both parents.</strong> Females, able to be certain whose chicks are
            their own, are much less obliging to adopt others. </p>
        <p>Though very poor at walking, the large wings, powerful hind leg and light body weight of the tribbfisher mean
            that <strong>if threatened it can vault itself into the air instantaneously and take flight, with no need
                for any running start</strong> as is often necessary for the larger aeracuda on the ground. </p>
        <p class="asterism">&#8258;</p>
        <p>The volanvenators may be diurnal hunters, but from them two other clades have diverged which have become
            nocturnal, resting during the day and feeding after dark. This has allowed these species to exploit food
            sources unused by their competitors, and has resulted in several interesting new adaptations.</p>
        <p>Only distantly related to the aeracuda or the tribbfisher, the<strong> moonbeast</strong> is one such
            nocturnal tribbat which has evolved a highly distinctive appearance as a result of specializing as a
            primarily auditory, rather than a strictly visual predator. And to do this, it has developed extraordinary
            ears that form a nearly complete disc around its face, channeling sound down to its ear opening like a
            satellite dish. Like an owl's, its ear holes are asymmetrical, the right lower than the left, which improves
            its ability to identify the direction of sound in three dimensional space. </p>
        <p><strong>A very large tribbat, second only to the aeracuda and weighing up to eight pounds, the moonbeast is a
                formidable predator</strong>. It is adapted to hunting in some of the the darkest environments on Serina
            - forests at night, where the planet light that often illuminates the sky enough to see by in more open
            settings is all but totally masked by the canopy of leaves above. With several species primarily native to
            northern Serinarcta, <strong>the moonbeasts are adapted to locate, catch and consume - whole - prey in
                almost total darkness entirely by sound. </strong>It hunts from a perch, turning its head from left to
            right until it catches a noise and then pinpoints the precise location a tiny rustle in the leaves or thump
            on a log originates from. When it has mapped the location in its mind, it swoops down, drops onto the source
            of the sound and pounces. If it has pinpointed the source correctly, it will close its especially wide jaws
            over some small molodont that emerged at precisely the wrong time from it burrow. <strong>With a gape that
                can swallow a prey item twice the diameter of its own head, the moonbeast has little need to
                chew</strong> and so its teeth are less specialized than in many other volanvenators; little more than
            conical points that provide a firm grip.</p>
        <figure><img src="images/8W49GuF.png" alt="moonbeast" />
            <figcaption>With an eerie, spectral appearance heightened by the wide disc its large ears form around its
                skull-like
                face, the moonbeast is a most unique tribbat. It is the tribbat equivalent to an owl and hunts small
                molodonts and other tribbetheres in near pitch black conditions.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Solitary and territorial, they give birth in tree hollows lined with soft mosses. <strong>Males do not take
                any part in child rearing in this group - the mother rears her offspring, usually twins, entirely on her
                own.</strong> Her young are thus born more developed than most, with fur coats that keep them warm as
            she hunts in the long nights. They fledge at only four weeks but <strong>depend on their mother unusually
                long, up to five months, perhaps because hunting by sound takes considerable practice to perfect than
                hunting by sight.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>The stark white face and red eyes of the moonbeast serve as a warning signal.</strong> The face shows
            the presence of a rival at a far distance in low light conditions, allowing individuals to avoid one
            another, and the bright red irises of their eyes against this backdrop - combined with a wide hissing jaw
            full of teeth - provide a stark threat display toward predators that might disturb one roosting in its nest
            by day. </p>
        <p class="asterism">&#8258;</p>
        <p>The second primarily nocturnal group of dividopteran
            tribbats is quite different from the moonbeasts</strong>, less specialized but more widespread. Though
            they hunt by night, they do so in more open environments where planetlight or starlight still illuminate the
            sky sufficiently to see and so they remain visual predators. Though not closely related to the moonbeast,
            they are generally allied by similarly wide mouths and are equally are adapted to swallow food whole in
            large gulps. Most forms are bat-like and catch large flying insects on the wing, but two notable outliers
            exist which will be covered here: the<strong> flapsnapper,</strong> and <strong>the night-biter</strong>,
            two closely related species which have evolved into a prey and predator relationship with a very unusual
            twist.
        </p>
        <p>The flapsnapper is a medium-sized tribbat with an extremely wide range over most of Serina north of the
            inland sea. Weighing just over one pound and with a maximum wingspan of two and a half feet, it is not a
            small tribbat but nor is it close to the largest. <strong>Habitat is of little importance to the
                flapsnapper, which hunts in the air well above the ground</strong>, and so can be found by day roosting
            in trees in forests or under rocks or even in burrows in plains and even arid regions. All that matters to
            the flapsnapper is that there be a readily accessible source of food to eat... and insects alone will not
            suffice to sate its hunger. Though it descends from insect-eaters, <strong>this form has become a specialist
                bird- and tribbat-eater.</strong> With jaws that expand far outward rather than forward, it easily
            swallows prey up to half its own weight.</p>
        <figure><img src="images/s3oHtbT.png" alt="flapsnapper" />
            <figcaption>With large eyes, maneuverable wings, and a massive mouth, the flapsnapper catches and swallows
                whole birds
                and smaller tribbats on the wing.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Climbing through branches at night with its curved wing claws it snatches any small flyers it finds sleeping
            from their roosts, and hunting at high altitudes at night it ambushes flocks of migratory birds,<strong>
                dropping from above and often catching and swallowing several in quick succession.
            </strong>Occasionally, it may also swoop and devour small tribbets, large insects, and occasionally even
            immature specimens of its own kind. Yet on the open, tropical grasslands of Serinarcta<strong> it has a
                preference for a very specific meal</strong>... one that can be especially nourishing.</p>
        <p>For it is here, on these open grasslands, that can still be found some of the early Ultimocene's most
            incredible and bountiful assemblages of megafauna. <strong>Herds of circuagodonts proliferate millions
                strong, chopping the grasses and herbs in their tree-trimmer jaws</strong>. Towering above them are the
            last of the serezelles - enormous, rumbling <strong>boomsingers</strong> - that plod along like mountains
            come to life. Weighing over fifteen tons and standing fifty feet tall, they browse along scattered trees
            without worry, protected as they are by their sheer enormity from any and all predators... <strong>or so it
                would seem.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>In fact, in the past million years, the boomsinger has found itself dealing with its first true
                predator in over ten million years.</strong> It isn't a circuagodont with sharp cutting teeth, however,
            nor a fast canithere or a large grappler with hooked tentacles. No, this enemy is smaller, seemingly
            insignificantly so to such a behemoth. And this is why it is so successful. You see, <strong>the only
                current predator of the boomsinger birds is a parasite</strong>; a two-ounce tribbat called the
            nightbiter, <strong>which has evolved to eat the boomsinger alive.</strong><br /><strong><br />The
                nightbiter is very closely related to the flapsnapper, the two species having diverged only four million
                years ago</strong>. While the latter grew larger into an active predator, the former stayed small and
            found a ready source of food in the form of tick-like parasites - giant mites - that plagued the skin of
            large animals. For at least a million years this was a mutual arrangement, with both parties benefiting from
            the partnership... but eventually the ancestors of the nighbiter became bolder. More efficient than waiting
            for ticks to collect blood was to enlarge the small wounds made by the parasites and drink the blood freely.
            The creatures also turned to congregating along existing wounds, biting the flesh - even richer than the
            blood - and preventing healing.<strong> They over time grew more powerful jaws and sharp teeth to cut
                through the thick skin of the large animals themselves.</strong> The teeth grew wide, triangular, and
            razor-sharp, so that the jaw could be protracted to dig them all into the flesh on the back of an animal.
            Then, when the jaw was pulled back, the teeth neatly scooped out a mouthful of skin, fat and muscle almost
            as big as the biter's own head - an incredibly rich meal. Today <strong>the nightbiter has become a
                terrestrial equivalent to the cookiecutter shark</strong>, a small flying animal that subsists entirely
            off of pieces of flesh bitten off of a giant living host.</p>
        <figure><img src="images/Aa2v0Dc.png" alt="nightbiter" />
            <figcaption>using its specialized cutting teeth and rounded jaw, the nightbiter feeds on living boomsinger
                birds, eating
                them bite by tiny bite.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p><strong>For a predator weighing an eighth of a pound, 15 tons of boomsinger provides quite literally
                limitless food, and flocks of the parasites can easily become a bane to the giants.</strong> They emerge
            from their sheltered hiding places by night - sometimes roosting by day even the folds of skin in the arm
            pits of their hosts - and fly to the hindquarters of the giant birds to feed. The boomsinger, living on such
            a larger scale than its assailants, is virtually helpless to their attacks, enduring an onslaught of tiny
            ice cream scoops that bite at its flanks like a cow endures fly bites. Adult boomsingers invariably show
            many of the silver dollar-sized scars their sharp jaws leave in their wake, and though each nightbiter only
            needs one meal every two or three days, the sheer quantity of regenerating food that whole herds of such
            giant animals can provide can mean that <strong>the parasites can easily reach plague population levels
                where thousands may feed on a single animal, putting it at genuine risk of succumbing to infection of
                unhealed wounds</strong> - a very literal death by a thousand cuts.</p>
        <p>But this is where the flapsnapper comes in. This larger tribbat predator holds no inhibitions against eating
            family, and<strong> it has become the primary limiting factor in the population of the nightbiter.</strong>
            A smaller tribbat that has just fed on a mouthful of bird flesh is extremely nourishing for itself, and so
            the predator becomes the prey. <strong>Flapsnappers are drawn to boomsinger herds in pursuit of gorged
                nightbiters</strong>, where they either snatch them right out of the air or land on the backs of the
            birds and suck them right off before they can disconnect their jaws and escape. Each flapsnapper can eat
            four or five nightbiters daily, and will do so every night if it can. They thus severely stress the
            parasites, limiting their populations and considerably reducing the time they spend biting their hosts, to
            the benefit of the boomsingers. Where flapsnappers are now found alongside nightbiters, <strong>they are
                kept at low enough populations that they do not cause enduring harm to their prey</strong>, and a
            balance occurs. <strong>In this way, this unusual food chain demonstrates the way that life ultimately finds
                a new equilibrium</strong>, adapting to check and balance changes to a formerly stable ecology, and
            eventually restoring that stability again.</p>
        <figure><img src="images/PjJk5O2.png" alt="boomsingers" />
            <figcaption>Under Serina's twilit night on the savannahs of Serinarcta a pair of giant boomsingers wanders,
                flanked by
                comparatively tiny circuagodont grazers, as several flapsnappers circle around them to hunt nightbiters.
                Once finding limitless food with these giant prey, today the nightbiter is itself heavily preyed upon
                and
                forced to maintain a low profile as the unwitting base of its own food chain.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>The final tribbat group that we will cover today is the most derived of all. While less physically strange
            perhaps than the moonbeast or the nightbiter, it is the <strong>vibropterans</strong> that are the most
            unusual of all divopterans... <strong>for they alone have forgone hunting almost entirely</strong>, trading
            flesh for the nectar of flowers, fruit, and the tiniest of flying insects. With 320 species, they are the
            most specious and currently the most rapidly evolving subclade of all tribbats in the early Ultimocene.
            <strong>Vibropterans are the best flyers of all tribbats</strong>, with small bodies and narrow wings that
            flap rapidly and allow hovering, <strong>and they are the group that is currently most competitive with
                birds</strong>, particularly the smaller sparrowgulls, whose niches they readily take over and who have
            no vulnerable eggs to protect from molodont egg-eating predators, for as with all tribbats they give live
            birth. Their flight is more energetically efficient than a birds, and they have one major advantage over
            many nectar-drinking birds particularly in cold climates; many can lower their body temperatures, slow their
            breathing, and <strong>hibernate through winter, thus avoiding migration</strong>. This is something that
            among other pollinating birds only the semi-carnivorous switchbeaks, a clade of metamorphic birds, can also
            manage.</p>
        <p>Vibropterans range in size from about an ounce - the size of a sparrow - down to two-tenths of an ounce;
            around the weight of a hummingbird. They may be small, but it is these among all tribbats who are the
            pinnacle of their long evolutionary history toward nimble flight, and subsequently which may ultimately go
            on to the biggest things.</p>
        <figure><img src="images/eh6qKG6.png" alt="vibropteryx" />
            <figcaption>Smaller than a human thumb, the blue-eared vibropteryx is among the smallest of all
                tribbetheres. A
                nectar-drinking specialist, it uses a long brush-tipped tongue to gather its food, which is supplemented
                with insects.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>These tiny nectivorous tribbats move through the air effortlessly, zooming up, down, and side to side with
            their wings fluttering through a full stroke up to fifty times a second. They come in brilliant colors, with
            new species evolving in a matter of just a few thousand years rather than millions, and each species marked
            boldly in its own distinctive color pallet. Golden, orange, red, black and white hair overlies blue, green
            or red skin that combines to create every color possible, often many in a single animal. Though they descend
            from carnivores that in turn became insectivores, and indeed share a more distant relationship with the
            flapsnapper and the nightbiter, they only supplement their diets with tiny insects today and instead greatly
            prefer sugar-rich food sources. The tribbat analogue to hummingbirds on Earth, these little flyers are very
            distinct in at least one way; whereas hummingbirds are fiercely territorial, these little guys are extremely
            social.</p>
        <p>Rich rainforests in central Serinarcta provide abundant blooms and berries, supporting flocks of these
            diminutive tribbats. <strong>By living in groups as they do, they must share all resources they find but
                this is outweighed by having the ability to maintain a far larger territory and defend it from
                rivals.</strong> When foraging, flocks flutter and fly from one sunlit flower patch to another,
            lingering for just a moment at each spot before moving on. They communicate with twitters and quiet hums,
            always maintaining awareness of where their companions are. Males and females flock together, females being
            promiscuous and every male getting an chance to mate, and all of the males assist in provisioning the young,
            reared in intricately woven nests of grass strung up from vines in bunches of three or four, and fed
            primarily insects before maturity. <strong>With numbers to back them, even these tiny tribbats can
                collectively defend their nests from predators</strong>, with some members of the flock often serving as
            a lure to turn their enemies' attentions away from their offspring.</p>
        <p><strong>With the largest brain to body ratio of all tribbats, vibropterans are highly intelligent.</strong>
            They have to be, for feeding on flowers requires remembering the location of every flowering plant in one's
            territory, but also the specific time - sometimes a span of only days - when it blooms, at one time of day,
            as well as when you've left fed there, for each flower only produces a small reward of nectar each meal and
            takes time to regenerate it. All of this information must be stored in their brains and forms a
            three-dimensional mental map of their environment containing the location of every single food source in
            their territory - which may be several acres horizontal and hundreds of feet vertical in the forest.
            <strong>And large brains allow for behavioral flexibility too,</strong> that can at times even subvert
            millions of years of evolution: birds and flowers, as well as flowers and insects, have established
            relationships going back countless millions of years, where plants and animals co-evolve to match - so that
            a certain birds' beak might match a certain flowers shape exactly. <strong>Vibropterans, clever creatures as
                they are, rapidly learn that if their tongues cannot reach down a flower to a pool of nectar, they can
                simply tear it apart with their wing claws to access the food within without pollinating it at
                all</strong>. Thus, as time goes on, these tiny nectivores which have already experienced such a rapid
            boom of physical diversity begin to shift toward increased behavioral complexity. <strong>And with many
                animals on Serina, once the ball towards complexity begins to roll, changes can accumulate quite
                quickly.</strong> To feed on a flower too big to reach with their tongues and too strong to tear with
            their claws, why not use a stick? By doing so, <strong>the vibropteran tribbats are thus the first
                tribbetheres to utilize tools.</strong> And they don't stop there; what other food sources might be
            accessible once you are not limited by your body to reach them? Other vibropterans learn to access the juicy
            interior of massive fruits, co-evolved with large herbivores who distribute the seeds inside and never meant
            for them, in the same way, and find food suddenly much more available - and easier to obtain - then if they
            relied on flowers alone.<br /> <br />The vibropterans - a clade of tiny, highly volant, intelligent,
            tool-using, social tribbats descended from large carnivores, prove that it is sometimes the most unusual
            forms that might ultimately be the most successful of all. And that the smallest of creatures <strong>that
                may prove to be some of the most important players in the game of life</strong>...</p>
        <p class="asterism">&#8258;</p>
        <p>Serina in the early Ultimocene is approaching an end - but it must be remembered, all that has changed since
            the Pangeacene, so far, is an arbitrary title. Though volcanism has become unpredictable and continental
            drift is now slowing to a stop, life goes on and evolution has not slowed. New clades continue to spread far
            and wide,<strong> as life tries ever newer things and finds solutions to ancient problems in novel
                ways</strong>. This is true of the tribbats as much as any other clade, and as they join <strong>ever
                more animal groups rising higher on the cognitive ladder</strong>, a great change looms on the distant
            horizon of time. Developing slowly but surely, and piece by small piece<strong>, a more complex biosphere
                than has existed ever before</strong> is still forming as the Ultimocene goes on. </p>
