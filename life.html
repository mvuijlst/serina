        <h1>Life Comes to Serina</h1>
        <p>The primary subject of Serina's existence as a sort of large-scale evolutionary experiment - like the island
            speciation of Darwin's finches, but on an immense, never before seen scale - was to be the canary bird, a
            finch itself. To survive, however, the canary bird would require a modest number of partners in the web of
            life. Food sources were vital, and so on our hypothetical world we must include at least a fair enough
            number so that our colonists do not immediately starve. As primarily seed-eating birds, which also partake
            in a fair amount of greens and a few insects for good measure, grasses and seed-bearing plants were vital to
            the foundation of the early canary-based ecosystem. The flora introduced to Serina's land were thus,
            primarily, plants upon which canaries would feed.</p>
        <p>A second need in crafting an ecosystem from the bare basics, though less immediately important to the birds
            themselves, were decomposers. Dead plant matter, droppings and the bodies of deceased canaries would build
            up and their nutrients remain locked up out of the environment without a healthy sampling of microfauna to
            break them down. Primarily to perform janitorial duty, detritivorous invertebrates such as earthworms,
            isopods, springtails and mites and scavengers such as ants, crickets and beetles were vital to establish a
            healthy ecosystem. To keep the flowing waters of the new world healthy also required a number of
            introductions; founded by algae and elodea - two plants also incidentally edible to canaries - small
            crustaceans, snails and worms also found a home. For added interest, we will also include a small number of
            fish; live-bearing ray-finned fishes of the genera Xiphophorus and Poecilia - common in the pet trade under
            their common names as platies, swordtails, guppies and mollies. These fish would stabilize the aquatic
            environments out of reach of the canaries, feeding on the algae and controling invertebrate populations. And
            though Serina will center upon the canary birds, especially at first, these secondary colonists will also be
            touched upon as they too evolve and adapt over countless generations to our little world.</p>
        <p>Beginning with the most primitive of plants and algae, over several million years Serina was gradually fitted
            with increasingly advanced organisms, building upon their earlier foundations just as one might build up a
            towering skyscraper, creating an ever increasingly complex system. Following the flora came the microsopic
            soil creatures - the nematodes, the worms, the vital detritivores - and then the invertebrates - the
            earthworms, the crickets, the shrimp and the snails. As complexity increased with each class of creature, so
            too reduced the number of forms introduced. Thousands of plants, hundreds of insects, but only seven species
            of vertebrates, only a single one of them terrestrial. It was this single creature however, the last
            crowning introduction to the world, that would perhaps most impact it. Perhaps it was chosen at random, or
            perhaps it had been planned from the very beginning. However it was chosen, however, nothing would ever be
            the same again following the release of the canaries upon the verdantly awaiting, endless meadows of their
            new kingdom.</p>

            <figcaption>The domesticated canary, <em>Serinus canaria domestica</em>, was the ancestor of all birds on
                Serina. </figcaption>
        </figure>


        <p>The Domestic Canary, <em>Serinus canaria domestica</em>, chosen for Serina, was a human-bred cultivar of the
            wild Atlantic canary, a small passerine bird belonging to the genus <em>Serinus</em> in the finch family of
            <em>Fringillidae</em>. Once native to the Canary Islands, the Azores, and Madeira of ancient Earth, these
            small birds became, following the seventeenth century, among the most commonplace of human house pets, with
            a captive range quickly coming to cover the whole of the planet as a result. Bred into forms carrying nearly
            any color of the rainbow, few if any would re-adapt to survive in the wild in a normal environment. Here,
            however, they found no predators. Food was abundant, enormously so. Life would be privileged for a time...
            but gradually, dynamics would begin to shift, as the silent and timeless processes of which the creators so
            longed to observe would begin their work upon the birds, as well as their compatriots - the fishes, the
            invertebrates, and the plants with which they shared their new world.</p>
        <p>Evolution would carry on and work quickly to re-claim what had so severely been interrupted by the old ones.
            From these few founding creatures, one day would a world of strange and wonderful life grow and develop.</p>
        <p>The following is a complete list of Serina's originally imported macroscopic organisms. Not included are the
            innumerable soil bacteria and fungal organisms vital to a stable ecosystem and the numbers of small
            invertebrates are approximate. Though Serina is most foremost the canvas for its namesake to claim, an
            ecology cannot subsist upon one bird alone and a great variety of other creatures have also been introduced
            to the world to fulfill other ecological niches. Only once these were in place and a basic ecosystem
            established could the true subjects of the project be introduced and expected to thrive. Following the
            departure by its mysterious creators, this motley assortment of beasts and flora would have been utterly on
            their own, to live or to die, to adapt or to perish, to die out or diversify in a world all their own.
            Though many creatures would diversify over the eons following, at least at first, none would compare to the
            humble canary. The world of birds was born. </p>
