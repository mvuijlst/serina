        <p>Imagine, if you will, a hypothotical world much like our own, but populated only by a very small sampling of
            creatures, which were then allowed to evolve entirely on their own for hundreds of millions of years until
            their ancestors resembled them barely at all. Now imagine if those colonists were highly specialized
            creatures, animals which would never have the means to exploit as many varied niches anywhere else due to
            competition from other animals. Imagine an entire world where the only land animal present is a canary - a
            world without reptiles, amphibians, or mammals. This is Serina - the world of birds.</p>
        <p>Serina is an ongoing, chronological world-building exercise and speculative evolution project that explores
            the natural history of a fictional terraformed moon, two thirds the size of Earth and orbiting a large gas
            giant in the habitable zone of an alternate solar system, populated by only a handful of organisms including
            grasses, sunflowers, ants, crickets, guppies, and - most notably of all - a single land vertebrate: the
            domestic canary. Our journey to this strange world will take us from the very beginning and then progress
            steadily along though the eons as the world's newly introduced life adapts to and evolves to suit its
            strange, new and ever-changing environment.</p>
        <p>It would be here, upon a little blue and green moon, perhaps put together by some unknown highly intelligent
            being(s) but soon after left to its own devices for countless millennia, a magnificent new biosphere would
            take shape. </p>
        <p>It was to be a world truly "for the birds" - but not in a bad way.</p>
