        <h1>Handfishes</h1>
        <p>In the middle Pangeacene, 228 million years since colonization, <strong>the fishes have established
                themselves firmly alongside the birds upon the land</strong>. The fully terrestrial descendants of
            live-bearing <em>Xiphophorus</em> fishes, descended from early amphibious <strong>mudwickets</strong>, have
            radiated into numerous forms including the warm-blooded <strong>tribbetheres</strong>, but these are but one
            branch of an even more diverse clade - the <em>Tripodichthya</em> - known informally as
            <strong>tribbets</strong>. </p>
        <p><strong>The first tribbets evolved from the mudwickets roughly 150
                million years ago</strong>, though their group as a whole, the <em>Pinnagrades</em>,
            which includes all mudwickets including tribbets, appeared more than
            160 million years ago. While the early mudwickets had already developed a
            mobile forelimb and finger-like fin rays to crawl over land, the
            tribbets were further distinguished by a fully impermeable skin, paired
            lungs (developed from an offshoot of the stomach), and a tail adapted to
            move in an up and down arc, rather than a strictly side to side one,
            which greatly improved the efficiency of their movement over the ground.
            Though it is difficult to distinguish exactly when the first tribbet
            evolved, as evolution is a gradual process of change,<strong> forms that were undeniably early tribbets had
                evolved by 65 million years PE</strong>, though did not speciate spectacularly until the warming climate
            at the start of the Thermocene ten million years later. </p>
        <p><strong>Tribbets evolved to be
                tripedal</strong>,
            adapting their pectoral fins and their tails simultaneously into
            walking limbs. Despite very different origins, natural selection in some
            groups - notably the <strong>tribbetheres</strong> - modified both
            structures into similarly jointed legs quite similar to those evolved by
            the tetrapod animals much earlier. In animals such as the hoppers and
            in particular their later descendants the molodonts, the leg structures
            are so similar that superficially, they are virtually identical. The
            tail has developed a series of joints allowing it to bend and flex
            similarly to the hind leg of a mammal or reptile, with the tip
            developing a fleshy weight-bearing pad frequently bearing ossified
            extensions of the spine which function as digits. The muscular "wrist"
            of the early mudwickets, meanwhile, has then elongated into a jointed
            arm with the fin rays forming a hand or foot on which the weight is
            supported, <strong>giving an overall impression that all three limbs
                share a common origin when in fact their underlying structures were once
                very different.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>However, this is not the case for all
                tribbets</strong>.
            In the Thermocene, the tribbets diversified considerably. From a
            starting point of two grasping, clawed wrists and a tail that allowed
            for a jerky inchworm-like locomotion, several groups experimented with a
            number of different variations on their ancestral bodyplan that
            included the upright-legged ancestors of tribbetheres, sprawling
            reptilian forms, entirely inchworm-like species and even animals that
            walked not on longer legs, but on long spider-like fingers. Though most
            of these aberrant forms were killed off during the Thermocene-Pangeacene
            extinction, leaving only a few primitive survivor species and a single
            species of tribbethere, the resulting evolutionary vacuum gave these
            hardy forms a second opportunity to diversify. While sprawling <strong>tribtiles</strong>
            and mammal-like tribbetheres with erect legs remained the dominant
            forms, however, they were not the only ones. Multiple tribbet groups
            followed in the footsteps of their more unusual lost relatives and
            followed similar paths to some of these earlier forms, including the
            legless bodyplan which was re-adopted shortly after the extinction
            event, <strong>but surely the most surprising form to reappear were the hand-fishes, clade
                Cheirichythes.</strong></p>
        <p>Instead of elongating their arms, as had the tribbetheres, the
            <strong>handfishes</strong>
            - descended from some small, lizard-like arboreal form to come through
            the end of the Thermocene - began to evolve very long fingers, with
            which it could more easily clamber up into the newly returning forests
            and capture prey. While the arm itself stayed proportionally small,
            sprawling and primitive, <strong>the first three of these extremely long
                digits which were suited to climbing and holding onto branches became
                longer and sturdier and eventually became like functional arms in their
                own right, evolving their own small protrusions that eventually became
                fractal fingers - digits branching off of other digits. </strong>The
            same process occurred in the tail; as the spine stayed short, the
            side-projected digits instead elongating into a grasping pincer,
            perfectly adapted to attain a sturdy grip in the treetops. Over time
            this structure enlarged into what effectively amounted to a pair of legs
            - really a large grasping hand that originated from a very short tail -
            and which also developed smaller extensions of tissue to improve its
            grip and eventually grasping "fingers" of its own. Known informally as <strong>spiderfrogs</strong>,
            their moniker is apt; their general appearance is amphibian, with a
            wide mouth, large eyes, and smooth - though not permeable - scaleless
            skin, <strong>coupled with four extremely long fingers on their forearms used to climb and capture
                food</strong>.
            Most species still hunt insects, using their fingers to grab prey they
            come across while climbing through the branches and stuff it into their
            toothy jaws. Some forms have become ambush predators of birds and other
            tribbets, hanging by their tails on the underside of branches with their
            fingers spread, ready to grasp any unfortunate passers-by in a deadly
            grip. Known as <strong>dropdowns</strong>, these have developed
            elongated, almost eel-like bodies able to curl upwards along the bottom
            of a tree branch. Camouflaged like the bark, they lie here in wait, held
            up by a powerful tail pincer, until some small animal passes beneath.
            They lie motionless, moving only their large eyes, until the prey is
            within range and strike with great speed. The splayed fingers are closed
            in a cage around the hapless victim and retract upward toward the
            predator's powerful jaws, where it is quickly dispatched. With slow
            metabolic rates, they can wait long periods between meals and move only
            rarely, under the cover of darkness, with an ungainly inchworm motion
            over the tops of the branches. </p>

                    three notable handfishes of the late Pangeacene; a primitive insectoid
                    predator (top), a brachiating, hexapedal gibbet (middle), and a dropdown
                    (bottom.)</figcaption></figure>
        <p>Some spiderfrogs are
            more active predators, which leap and chase after their food. The
            pinnacles of this evolutionary pathway - and the tribbets with the most
            specialized fingers and tail of all - are the <strong>Gibbets</strong>, a clade of extremely aberrant
            spiderfrog that appeared roughly 15 million years ago.</p>
        <p>Gibbets are spiderfrogs with two
            hypertrophied fin rays on each stumpy forearm <strong>which have become so large as to function as
                individual arms in their own right,</strong> making the gibbet <strong>a truly hexapedal animal and the
                first terrestrial vertebrate to fit this description</strong>.
            Though they retain four digits on their wrists, only the first two on
            each are functional. The tail is extremely short, just three vertebrae
            in length, from which project two enormous jointed limbs that were
            originally derived from the small fingers that allowed the tail to
            grasp. <strong>Each hypertrophied finger is now proportionally longer than the limb that bears it and work
                together as a pair of legs</strong>,
            giving the gibbets exceptional dexterity in the treetops versus other
            tribbets which have only a single tail limb to work with. The two hind
            legs and four front legs of a gibbet give it an edge in climbing, as it
            can always be holding on with at least one or two legs while it moves
            through the branches and thus very rarely slips. They are predators of
            insects, though some species are omnivorous, and are lively, energetic
            creatures with higher metabolisms than their relatives and indeed most
            other tribbets. While not as fully warm-blooded as the tribbetheres, <strong>they are truly mesothermic -
                able to raise their body temperatures several degrees above their ambient environment</strong>
            - and thus can remain active in a wider range of temperatures. Even so,
            they - like most spiderfrogs - are restricted to warmer tropical and
            subtropical forest habitats, where they thrive in the high canopy.</p>
