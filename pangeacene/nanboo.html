        <h1>The Nanboo Forest</h1>
        <p><strong>Nanboo</strong> are enormous forest-forming grasses which evolved in Serina's tropics in the early
            Pangeacene, <strong>which can reach heights of up to one hundred and fifty feet</strong>. Their growth habit
            is bamboo-like and the trunks above ground originate from a <strong>large underground rhizome which spreads
                via underground runners</strong>, but the nature of the trunks is very different. <strong>Nanboo lack
                the ability to produce woody tissue</strong> and thus the <strong>entire above ground portion of the
                plant is actually composed of leaves</strong> which sprout directly from the root system; they are thus
            actually enormous herbs, and not proper trees. The trunk is formed by greatly enlarged petioles, or leaf
            stalks, which are hollow and tube-like. <strong>New leaf blades sprout up through the tube of older ones,
                which expand outward to accommodate them, only unfurling once they reach the top of the tube</strong>.
            Subsequently, the next leaf produced rises up through the hollow center of the previous leaf and so on until
            a trunk-like form is obtained, actually many tightly-packed layers of leaf stems growing up through one
            another. <strong>Each new leaf becomes longer and wider than those before it so that over time, the oldest
                leaves on the outer edges of the stem eventually can expand no further and split, drying and shedding
                onto the ground</strong>. The result, after the growth of many leaves, is a thick, fleshy trunk composed
            of dozens of condensed stems supporting a cluster of large strap-like leaves at its top. This growth habit
            is shared exactly with banana plants on Earth, from which the nanboo inherits half of its common name and
            closely resembles. The emergent leaves at the top of the nanboo's trunk, in addition to the hidden length in
            the center of the stem, can grow an additional thirty feet long and ten feet wide, <strong>making them
                unquestionably the largest single leaves of any plant. </strong></p>
        <p>Combining the herbaceous nature of banana plants with the large spreading root systems of the grass family,
            nanboo are highly vigorous and extraordinarily fast-growing plants when mature, <strong>some species able to
                add six feet or more of stem height per day</strong> when growing from a large root stock. Because their
            stems are soft, they can be produced extremely quickly, <strong>making nanboo forests especially resilient
                to natural disasters</strong>. Severe weather conditions, such as hurricanes, which would devastate
            communities of woody trees for years are only a nuisance to established nanboo forests, which can recover to
            heights of ten to twenty feet or more in only a few weeks' time when conditions improve by relying on energy
            stored in the gigantic underground root system alone. Though it may take them considerably longer to restore
            their previous heights, this is more than sufficient to dramatically out-compete any potential competitors
            starting from seed and to return the soil to shaded conditions. <strong>Nanboo are thus more or less immune
                to the natural process of succession once established </strong>and will hold their place in a forest
            ecosystem indefinitely unless long-term climactic conditions change substantially. </p>
        <p>Nanboo seedlings can survive in a variety of light conditions, from full sun to deep shade, though grow most
            vigorously in open conditions. Seedlings generally <strong>cannot establish themselves well in ant forests
                because they are trimmed indefinitely</strong> and prevented from reaching the canopy, but
            <strong>established colonies with much greater rates of growth are a rare example of a plant which can
                overtake them</strong>. New stems rising from the soil and approaching an ant tree are chewed and
            attacked defensively, like any competitor, but whereas other plants would be stopped from growing if their
            tops were trimmed, this is not the case for nanboo. <strong>Just like how small grasses can continue to grow
                even when their tops are cut by grazers, but on a massive scale, nanboo grows from the bottom up in
                opposite to most plants and thus will continue attaining height even if its top is chewed off,</strong>
            reaching toward the canopy and eventually surpassing it. Once here, it is largely left alone by the insects,
            which don't target the trunks of other trees but only their new growth, and can spread its leaves over the
            tops of the other trees, shading them out. <strong>Nanboo forest readily becomes the dominant forest
                community in the tropics</strong>, where rainfall is reliable and abundant, allowing them to overtake
            almost all competitors. <strong>In dry conditions, however, nanboo is extremely unsuited,</strong> as its
            soft stems are totally unguarded against dehydration. The drier a climate becomes moving across Serina from
            the equator toward the interior desert, the nanboo present there become shorter and less vigorous,
            <strong>eventually reduced to a ground cover of short herbs less than a meter high and growing in the shade
                of woody trees where they are protected from drying winds</strong>. Nanboo is also limited by cold, its
            above ground stems being killed by temperatures below freezing and its sizes in seasonal environments
            therefore limited to as much as it can obtain in a single growing season as it dies back to its roots each
            winter. </p>
        <p>Nanboo are remarkably vigorous plants which can out-compete almost all comers in ideal environmental
            conditions and dominate Serina's wettest equatorial environments almost exclusively. The largest tree-like
            forms, however, are notably limited in their distribution because without stable, ideal conditions, its
            vigor rapidly declines and it loses ground to slower-growing but more adaptable woody plants. Because of
            these constraints, nanboo is not usually a major forest-forming plant in temperate forests, nor in arid
            climates or regions where rainfall is seasonal, and thus ant trees and other sunflowers continue to thrive
            in abundance over most of Serina. </p>
        <p>Even in drier environments, however, <strong>there are occasional circumstances that will allow for the
                formation of a nanboo-dominated woodland,</strong> if only temporarily. Most frequently, this comes
            about after an intense wildfire swipes through a community of woody plants, killing the majority and opening
            the forest floor up to a flood of sunlight. If the fire is followed within a few months' time by a period of
            rain, nanboo formerly growing as a short carpet of herbs on the previously shaded forest floor <strong>will
                respond to the change and grow rapidly to tree-like proportions many times their former height, briefly
                shading out competitors and bursting into flower and setting seed before the dry season returns and
                causes them to die back to the ground</strong>. They may get two or even three seasons as trees before
            the woody trees recover and begin to shade them out, relegating them back into the shadows. <strong>Some
                species of nanboo rely on this circumstance exclusively and will only flower after fire,</strong> when
            the rest of the forest is killed back, and <strong>which spend most of their lives otherwise, sometimes for
                decades, as low-growing under story plants.</strong></p>
        <p class="asterism">&#8258;</p>
        <p><strong>Nanboo trunks each flower only once</strong>, much like early bamboo. The flower bud, like the
            leaves, originates from the roots and grows upward on a rigid stem through the center of the trunk,<strong>
                eventually rising beyond it to heights in the tallest species of up to 175 feet, making them at least by
                measurement of their height the largest flowers ever to exist. </strong>The flower stem is very wide and
            more rigid than the leaves, causing the trunk to split as it pushes up through it so that by the time it
            reaches the top of the stem, the original trunk and therefore the stem's leaves have torn apart and dropped
            to the ground, leaving a single immensely tall blossom stalk standing freely in the forest, sometimes more
            than five feet wide at its base. Blooming is a grand affair. <strong>Distantly related to chokeweed, nanboo
                belongs to the same ancient group of grasses which evolved to produce colorful flowers pollinated by
                animals</strong>, and its flowers are very showy indeed. They are born on the stem in great panicles
            which may collectively contain ten thousand or more, each two to three inches wide and colored brightly
            yellow, pink, or even blue and which are pollinated mainly by tribbats and birds, with specific species
            often having preferred pollinators. Some are white, intended to attract nocturnal animals and thus opened
            only at night. <strong>The flowers contain deep nectaries accessible only to animals with long bills, like
                birds, or tongues, like tribbats, and are thus not very attractive to most insects except certain
                beetles with long extensible proboscis which can be dipped into the blossoms to feed.</strong> After
            pollination, the massive flower produces a glut of fig-like fruits favored by myriad creatures, which
            disperse their seeds in their droppings or on their bodies. Once the last fruit has ripened, <strong>the
                flower stalk withers and falls to the ground, but the colony which produced it survives and thus the
                plant as a whole is perennial. </strong></p>

            <figcaption><strong>above:</strong> a brightly-colored tribbat extends its jaws to reach the deep nectaries
                of a giant nanboo blossom.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Though flowering is an extraordinary event in the nanboo,<strong> it is also a relatively rare one</strong>.
            Though in the tropics at least a few blooming and fruiting stalks can be found at any one time over any
            given area and are among the most important food sources to many jungle animals, they are far outnumbered by
            flowerless stems and indeed <strong>the vast majority of trunks will never produce a bloom stalk</strong>,
            and those which will are predetermined from the time they are produced by the root system. The more numerous
            non-flowering stems typically cease growth shortly after surpassing the canopy and thereafter cease to grow
            any more leaves, lasting for several years before dying off and serving only to produce energy for the
            colony via photosynthesis.<strong> Flowering only begins once a colony is many years old and most
                reproduction occurs through the spreading of the root system</strong>, which can over time result in a
            single colony covering several miles of land - <strong>effectively a superorganism, and surely among the
                largest ever to exist</strong>. There is a danger to such a lack of genetic diversity, however, in that
            periodically <strong>plagues may wipe out entire forests.</strong> By reproducing through sexual means
            periodically and producing offspring with a new gene combination, the nanboo assures its future
            security,<strong> as at least some of these outbred seedlings, produced in such numbers as they are, will
                likely be resistant to any pathogens which may wipe out their fore-bearers.</strong></p>
