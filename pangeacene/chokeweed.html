        <h1>Chokeweed</h1>
        <p><strong>Chokeweeds</strong> are several related species of <strong>parasitic grass</strong> that prey on
            other plants, often trees but sometimes plains grasses, found across Serina in the Pangeacene in almost all
            environments except extreme alpine and desert, but particularly within the tropics. <strong>Their form is
                highly derived into a long, curling vine</strong> with leaves modified into <strong>twining, wire-like
                tendrils up to five feet in length that search out nearby plant stems</strong> and, when they find one,
            curl around it with great tenacity until the neighboring stalk is firmly held and the weeds' own stem is
            pulled into physical contact with that of its victim. As soon as a hold is established,<strong> it produces
                roots from the node from which the tendril originated which burrow into the stem of the captured
                plant</strong> and once there branch out into numerous, minute threads which spread like fungal bodies
            through its tissues and thread between individual cells, <strong>piercing their cell walls and hijacking
                their supply of both moisture and nourishment for its own use</strong>. Once the chokeweed has
            established itself in one stem, it immediately begins searching for another, putting out a new tendril,
            pulling itself a little higher off the ground, and going onward until a very old plant may stretch for
            hundreds of feet up through the jungle canopy. Stems may break off an established plant to no ill effect, so
            long as the severed portion has its own roots, and the lower portion will quickly produce a new leading
            shoot. <strong>Chokeweed never roots into the soil,</strong> and the production of roots is directly related
            to the presence of growth hormones detected in other living plants. </p>

        </figure>
        <p><strong>Chokeweeds vary from semi-photosynthetic to totally parasitic</strong>. Though a handful of species
            can produce a small part of their own energy needs from the sun, most are entirely reliant on stealing
            nourishment from other plants and most species - lacking green chlorophyll - <strong>are colored brightly in
                shades of yellow, red, and purple</strong>. Because of this, chokeweeds are easily spotted among the
            leaves of their host plants and often quite beautiful. Their effects on the plants they victimize, however,
            are less so. Large trees may consider the chokeweed only a nuisance, but seedlings - even sapling several
            years old - can be so heavily attacked that they are starved of nutrients and die under a mass of the
            parasite. <strong>Chokeweeds are unusual in that they are largely left alone by symbiotic ants which
                normally aggressively remove competitive plants from their host trees</strong>. This is because, by
            parasitizing the tree and taking up its nutrients, <strong>they also take in their growth hormones and thus
                their distinctive scent, which the ants utilize to recognize their hosts.</strong> Even though the
            parasite looks nothing like the host, <strong>the ants identify it as their own. </strong>So left alone, it
            can spread densely through the forest in thick tangles. </p>
        <p>To reproduce,<strong> chokeweed has taken to using animal carriers</strong>, one of only a few grasses to do
            so; ancestral grasses were wind-pollinated, but wind is absent in the jungle where many chokeweeds live, and
            so most chokeweeds have had to adapt to using animal pollinators. <strong>Their flowers are remarkably large
                and colorful for a grass, likely because as a parasite the chokeweed doesn't need to worry about wasting
                any of its hard-earned resources.</strong> Its flowers are thus extremely showy, fragrant, and born in
            dangling, pendulous bundles - as long as six feet in some jungle species - that descend down from the
            canopy, where they attract a variety of pollinators including not only the ants that guard the tree but
            vespers, beetles, birds and even tribbats. Once fertilized, each blossom produces a small, berry-like pod
            which contains hundreds of tiny seeds. The seeds are buried in a thick, sticky flesh relished by all sorts
            of animals, from birds to tribbetheres and many sorts of insects, which pass them in their droppings when
            they eat the fruit whole and also get the seeds stuck to their beaks, paws, legs and mouthparts,
            <strong>where they are likely to eventually rub off on a branch as the animal moves on after
                feeding</strong>. Whether a seed lands on a new plant stem in a birds' droppings or on a tribbat's hand
            doesn't matter much to the chokeweed, so long as it reaches another host. <strong>Only here will it
                germinate</strong>, injecting its first root into the tissue of an established vascular plant and
            therefore starting its life as a full-fledged parasite independent of the ground. If a seed falls to the
            ground, it will never germinate, or if it did, would quickly starve to death. </p>
        <p>Most chokeweeds are generalists and not specific to a single host species, though species do generally grow
            either in trees or on the ground, victimizing other grasses, and differ in the form of their flower stems
            (the former growing downward in hanging bunches, the latter up above the grass on thick stalks.) </p>
