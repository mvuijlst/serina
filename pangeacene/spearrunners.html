        <h1>Spearrunners</h1>
        <p><strong>Spearrunners</strong> are large carnivorous <strong>serezelles</strong> found over much of the
            tropical and subtropical regions of the supercontinent in the late Pangeacene, but particularly the vast,
            warm grasslands found skirting the desert north of the southern interior. They are cursorial quadrupeds that
            feed mostly on small animals and are anatomically little changed from other members of their group in form,
            excluding their highly elongated, spearing bills. They are covered in a sparse, shaggy plumage over the
            head, neck and torso but are featherless on all four limbs, which also lack scales and are simply covered in
            a thick hide that serves to radiate excess heat, and are minimally sexually dimorphic, with males typically
            being larger and exhibiting a mobile crest on their foreheads and small brightly-colored wattles and bare
            skin patches along the face. They are descended from a population of primitive omnivores which consumed
            small insects and animals in addition to plant foods, a generalist tendency which would end up being their
            saving grace when the strictly vegetarian members of their family would succumb to environmental change and
            competition from newly-evolving herbivorous tribbetheres.</p>

            <figcaption><strong>above:</strong> a male great plains spearrunner - the largest of all spearrunners -
                catches a molodont on the dry southern grasslands of Late Pangeacene Serina.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>There are six species of spearrunners extant by this time, the smallest approximately the size of a sheep and
            the largest weighing three hundred pounds and standing up to six feet tall at the shoulder. All of them are
            nearly exclusive carnivores, though they will also eat certain fruits, and prey mostly upon the various
            tribbets as well as any other birds they can capture, particularly the flightless juveniles of ornimorphs
            and the young and eggs of ground-dwelling fowl. The largest species can take prey as large as adult
            circuagadonts, but given a choice prefer smaller prey items as the toothy beak of these animals can
            potentially cause great injury if an initial attack fails to subdue the victim. Spearunners hunt by one of
            two means; Smaller species prefer to take burrow-dwelling prey, which is quietly stalked from above in a
            patient waiting game and usually ambushed as soon as it emerges from the ground to forage, either instantly
            or after a brief high-speed chase. Though the largest species will also feed in this way, it is better
            suited to endurance running and prefers hunting faster, larger prey that does not find refuge underground.
            To take down these animals involves a contest of endurance, with the predator trailing its victim until it
            collapses and then dispatching it.</p>
        <p>Spearrunners do not form pair bonds and only the female cares for the young. Males and females are equally
            solitary for most of the year, but males gather in leks in the mating season to attract females. As in other
            serezelles, the reproductive system is very mammalian, and the young develops inside the mother. After six
            to ten months, a single fuzzy chick or rarely twins is born alive and can run within a few days of birth.
            Because at this stage it would be a liability on the hunt, however, it is instead left alone in a sheltered
            thicket of tall grass for the first few weeks and fed just once a day for a few minutes on a highly
            nutritious oil produced in the mother's crop. Eventually, the mother begins bringing back whole prey and
            then injured but still living animals on which the chick can hone its predatory instincts and by two months
            of age it is competent enough to follow its mother regularly on her hunts and further practice its skills.
            The mother-offspring bond is weak, and the young is independent by six months of age, though is not fully
            grown until six to twenty months later, following with the changeling bird tendency to become independent
            well before adulthood. This has been a reversion from the extremely rapid development of the ancestral
            perching bird to a state more like the dinosaurs from which they descended.</p>
