        <h1>Sparrowgulls: Return of the Perching Birds</h1>
        <p>The Pangeacene was notable for ushering in a new age of birds, where the aberrant
            <strong>changelings</strong>, or metamorph birds, became the most abundant bird clade, almost completely
            displacing other groups of flying birds. Until the end of the Thermocene, there had always remained at least
            a few groups of primitive passerines, lineages which persisted almost as living fossils through the ages,
            with a body plan basic but highly effective. Though the basic form survived through the adults of some
            changeling birds, there were no egg-laying songbirds. The small birds which flitted through the trees
            through the early Pangeacene began their lives as some variation of larvae, and reached their adult state
            only after a period of metamorphosis. </p>
        <p>In the extreme environmental conditions of the Thermocene-Pangeacene boundary, it was a species of these
            metamorphosing perching birds that happened to be best suited to survive, but until that time the changeling
            birds were not inherently more adaptable than egg-laying forms and did not compete with them heavily. As the
            environment stabilized and life recolonized a largely sterilized world, it was almost inevitable that at
            least one of the surviving shelled-egg-laying birds, which included the flightless water snuffle,
            ground-nesting waterfowl, and a single species of cliff-nesting seabird, would re-diversify to at least some
            extent. Evolution was not a linear process with a set endpoint, but a here-and-now selective process, the
            pressures driving it constantly changing. <strong>And if those conditions were to change in the right way,
                an adaptation formerly deleterious can become advantageous again.</strong></p>
        <p>This is is exactly what has occurred among the flying birds in the late Pangeacene. 52 million years have now
            amassed since the end of the Thermocene, and <strong>the demographic of the flying bird clades have seen
                significant shift</strong>, as Serinan <strong>gulls</strong> - not actually gulls in the strict sense
            of course but an ancient lineage of generalist seabird canaries - have commanded an impressive radiation
            back into inland environments. In a stable, warm environment, nesting and raising eggs was not inherently
            inefficient in small flying birds and this method of reproduction has come back into fashion with the
            evolution of the <strong>sparrowgulls.</strong></p>
        <h2>Sparrowgulls</h2>
        <p>Sparrowgulls are, in a sense, <strong>a reversion of form back to traditional perching birds</strong>, with
            some small differences.<strong> Their underlying forms are conservative and familiar,</strong> having
            changed very little over the ages, and though a small number of species of these seabirds had returned
            inland by the early Pangeacene, they were greatly outnumbered by an explosive diversity of metamorph birds
            and did not amount to anything significant. Toward the middle of the period, however, they had found an
            environment where they had an upper hand competitively: the dry southern desert. In very dry conditions,
            changelings do poorly. While it is true that forms are adapted which can develop in vernal pools and rapidly
            develop into adults before the waters dry up - like certain desert amphibians - there are very few other
            mediums available in a very dry environment in which the changelings, with their gelatinous eggs and
            moisture-dependent larvae, can reproduce. And just as there are a handful of frogs which can survive in an
            Earth desert but a much greater diversity of hard-shelled, egg-laying reptiles, <strong>the dry interior was
                a great place for a bird which laid watertight eggs. </strong></p>
        <p>The exact sequence of habits <strong>which led an ocean-feeding seabird to life in the dry interior
                desert</strong> is not entirely known, but can be inferred. The ancestors of the sparrow gulls surely
            evolved in the southern hemisphere, and likely initially began hunting abundant insects in the coastal
            grasslands that sprawled in the far south between the desert and the coasts, and only from there gradually
            moved further inland, where they found minimal competition from other birds. They did not initially return
            to trees or develop any perching adaptations save for losing the webbing on their toes, as trees were few
            and far between in these environments, and so they remained ground-nesters which often sheltered their eggs
            under patchy desert brush or outcroppings of stone. <strong>The first sparrowgulls were well-established
                across the arid interior by 228 million years PE</strong>, but did not venture significantly beyond it.
        </p>
        <p>In the last twelve million years, <strong>the climate became wetter and the desert receded.</strong>
            Grassland and vegetation moved inland, and with it a larger number of egg-eating predators, molodonts,
            bumblets, and early carnivorous serezelles among them. <strong>If the birds did not rapidly adapt, they
                would die out</strong>, and surely many could not adapt their behavior in time to survive. The
            sparrowgulls which only laid their eggs in a bare scrape on the ground, as they'd done for millions of
            years, were selectively culled, while more adventurous individuals which built more complex nests of grasses
            and twigs and placed these nests higher up on the branches of trees and plants experienced greater success
            in rearing their offspring. It became necessary to be able to build their nests on thinner branches in order
            to avoid climbing predators, but having totally lost their hallux toe they were at a disadvantage to
            redevelop a secure perching grasp to hold onto such thin footing as their ancestors could. The result, an
            adaptation which occurred six million years ago, <strong>was the movement of the outermost digit backwards
                to replace it</strong>, giving them two toes facing forward and one set back - <strong>a bit less stable
                than the four toes of their ancestors, but a functional system. </strong></p>
        <p>At the same time, many of <strong>the different lineages of changeling birds had already become extremely
                specialized</strong>, with many such as the serezelles and ornimorphs, let alone aquatic neotenic forms,
            moving dramatically far and away from any semblance to their original adult perching bird forms and niches.
            By the late Pangeacene, the metamorph birds had largely evolved away from traditional songbird niches into
            highly specialized new forms, with vastly unrelated molodonts and other tribbets now having monopoly of food
            sources such as grass seeds that were formerly relied upon by a huge variety of birds. This process was
            gradual and not a direct result of competition. The result, however, was that <strong>many of these niches
                had been left open to be reclaimed by different birds.</strong></p>
        <p>The <strong>newly-arboreal sparrowgulls were now well-suited to that task</strong> and began to move out of
            their dry homelands towards the forests of the equator and beyond. In six million years, this third wave of
            generalist perching birds has dispersed over most of the world, taking advantages of a great variety of food
            sources. The primitive songbird form which had stood the test of time until so recently would not be lost
            from the world of Serina just yet. As almost all other life on Serina was evolving down increasingly strange
            and specialized paths, <strong>one group of birds were doing the total opposite</strong> and returning to
            their ancestral forms. <strong>The plain, but persisting, shell-egged birds were reclaiming the world that
                could never have existed in the first place without them.</strong></p>
