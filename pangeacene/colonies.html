        <h1>Undersea Savannahs, Planktants, Snail Reefs, and Chainjelly Colonies</h1>
        <p>Across tropical seas worldwide lie some of Serina's most ecologically diverse and productive biomes:
            <strong>aquatic grasslands, stony reefs</strong>, and a unique new biome produced by floating colonies of
            photosynthetic jellyfish known as <strong>chainjellies</strong>. </p>
        <p>The <strong>Sea bamboos</strong> which were the only members of their once abundant lineage to come through
            the end of the Thermocene have come to dominate the shallow seas of the Pangeacene to a scale never before
            seen, where they cover the sea floor in a thick, green underwater grassland rife complete with its own
            pollinators, grazers, and predators. Whereas on Earth similar biomes - inhabited by the seagrasses - can
            develop only on coastal shallows, on Serina where the sea is typically substantially shallower, such plants
            can grow successfully many hundreds of miles out at sea, where the water may still be only as deep as 200
            feet, but still thrive best in slightly more coastal waters less than 100 feet in depth.</p>
        <p>Tropical oceans are extremely abundant in light and warmth, <strong>but normally are severely lacking in
                nutrients and at any distance from shore can often be considered virtual deserts</strong>. This has not
            stopped the expansion of the sea grass savannah, however, <strong>which survives and even thrives in these
                warm, calm seas through an extremely efficient recycling of organic material.</strong> As the earliest
            beds of sea bamboo spread out from shallow coasts, they brought with them biological communities of fishes
            and small invertebrates which fed upon them. Such creatures, living within the tangles of the bamboo, ensure
            that no organic matter is wasted; the nutrients in the foliage which is eaten are promptly returned to the
            grasslands in the form of animals' waste products and rapidly re-absorbed by the rest of the plants.
            Furthermore, the small organisms living in the grasslands draw in larger shoals of predators from the open
            sea in search of food which in turn deliver more nutrients into the system. <strong>Sea bamboo habitats are
                thus extraordinarily fertile, providing islands of refuge between areas of deeper water</strong> that
            may in isolated places extend down to depths of 6,000 feet - still far shallower than the larger seas of
            Earth, but much too deep for sunlight to penetrate and allow the growth of the bamboo. </p>
        <p>Sea bamboo grows as a spreading rhizome across the sea floor, which produces leafy canes which can vary in
            growth habit from just a few inches in height to vines that tangle together and float in mats on the surface
            hundreds of feet in length, providing welcome cover to thousands of species of fish, mollusks, crustaceans,
            marine insects and neotenic birds. Shrimp, crabs, copepods and snails feed on either the leaves of the grass
            itself or on the layer of microorganisms that cover them - the "biofilm" - and in turn provide food for
            larger animals. <strong>Enormous dugong-like descendants of the water snuffle glide through the
                glades</strong>, some feeding on buried mollusk prey they unearth with an electrosensitive snout and
            others browsing the grass itself with a flexible tentacled upper lip. <strong>Nimble sea turtle-like
                descendants of mucks "fly" over the "plains" with wing-like flippers</strong>, cropping the bamboo with
            their beaks, and returning to shore only to lay their eggs in the sand. Shoals of fish seek shelter between
            the tangles of foliage from predators in the form of barracuda-like ray-finned fishes which descend from the
            small surviving saltwater minnows of the Thermocene-Pangeacene boundary, <strong>agile seal-tribbets which
                have taken to the water from a dog-like ancestor</strong>, and sea birds that dive below the surface
            like missiles in their pursuit of prey. Though now wholly aquatic, <strong>sea bamboo is still a flowering
                plant and reproduces by seed in addition to spreading vegetative growth</strong>. To do so, its
            inconspicuous flowers, almost hidden in the axils of its leaves, are normally pollinated by the currents,
            but in the absence of strong water movement <strong>also benefit from the actions aquatic invertebrates act
                like bees on land</strong>, attracted to the pollen as a food source but inadvertently transferring some
            of it between the flowers as they swim from flower to flower. Species which the undersea savannah recruits
            as its pollinators include copepods, shrimp, crab larvae, and<strong> even a family of tiny, entirely marine
                ants</strong> which have become efficient free-swimmers with paddle-like limbs and feathery hind legs -
            actually masses of thousands of tiny cillia branching off the exoskeleton - <strong>that serve as gills to
                absorb oxygen from the water with no need to surface for air. </strong></p>
        <p>Known as <strong>planktants</strong>, these species are the direct descendant of the sea ants of the
            Thermocene, which survived the mass extinction event along with the sea bamboos they depended on in a
            handful of shallow isolated coastal estuaries and pockets of oxygenated water that persisted throughout the
            stagnant ocean. As the seas recovered in the Pangeacene, the surviving ants diversified substantially and
            spread across the tropical seas. Some species of planktant are solitary while others are social, but none of
            the truly aquatic gilled ants are eusocial; rather, flashing along through the water in search of edible
            tidbits, female carry broods of their eggs under their own bodies which will hatch as miniature versions of
            themselves. <strong>They have abandoned their larval stages completely</strong>, giving birth to
            fully-formed nymph-like young in a reversal of their ancestral metamorphosis and removing the need for a
            nest at all. In the case of the female, the only changes the nymph will undergo after birth involve an
            increase in size over several molts. In males, however, after a short period of life as an aquatic animal
            much like the female, <strong>they molt into a very different form which, though still gilled, also sports
                folded, stunted wings. </strong>The young males then rise to the surface in immense numbers to complete
            a second molt almost immediately where their wings fully unfold. <strong>Now a mature adult, the male of the
                species retains gills on its hind legs but has now also developed the open spiracles of its ancestors
                which are adapted to atmospheric respiration.</strong> It thus has a short period of time where it can
            breathe both under and below the water, giving the males time to surface and take flight. After just an hour
            in the air, however, its gills dry and are shed and it will now drown if it falls back in the water and
            cannot escape quickly. Living for just a day or two, the male does not feed as an adult and dedicates its
            entire life to <strong>depositing microscopic pouches of sperm into the water, which the planktonic females
                will locate by scent and collect to fertilize their eggs and start a new generation.</strong></p>

            <figcaption>
                <p><strong>above:</strong> a typical female planktant. Most planktants are semi-transparent, with
                    reflective exoskeletons that give them a bluish cast and serve to hide their form in open water.
                    Though a few forms may reach up to an inch in length, the vast majority are smaller than one
                    centimeter and some just a few millimeters in size. In general, they are inconspicuous but super
                    abundant along reefs and sea bamboo grasslands, where they feed on phytoplankton and small organic
                    particles, such as pollen. Locomotion occurs with flaps of the second and hind leg pairs, while the
                    first pair have adapted into grasping arms to procure food. The gills can be seen as hair-like
                    filaments growing out from the inside of the hindmost legs.<br />The antennae of planktants are very
                    long in order to better sense water vibration to avoid predators and improve their sense of smell.

        <p><strong>The dispersal of flying males is dependent entirely on weather conditions</strong>, and if the males
            molt at the wrong time, when the water is too turbulent as a result of stormy weather, <strong>an entire
                generation can be lost</strong>. This is not a deadly blow to the planktants in general, though, for the
            females can successfully reproduce through parthenogenisis, cloning themselves for many generations in the
            absence of a male and biding their time until a flush of males can successfully take flight and renew the
            genetic diversity of the population. Though this is obviously ideal for keeping the population genetically
            fit, <strong>some species have nonetheless emerged in which males seem not to exist at all, whose lines can
                be traced back entirely through cloned females for at least the past 500,000 years.</strong> In stable
            environmental conditions, as have returned in the Pangeacene, it is not always necessary to be capable of
            rapid change to survive, <strong>though as soon as conditions change markedly it is likely these species
                will be displaced by those which still use sexual reproduction to mix and match their genes and stand a
                better chance of adapting.</strong></p>
        <p>Though the bamboo ant trees which once dominated Serina on land are now gone and all but forgotten, as long
            as the planktants are still swimming about, pollinating the flowers of the sea bamboo grasslands,
            <strong>the ancient ant/bamboo symbiosis which has been occurring on Serina for more than two hundred
                million years lives on.</strong></p>
        <p class="asterism">&#8258;</p>
        <p>Where waters are too deep for sea bamboo to take root, another exotic ecosystem thrives in the tropical seas
            of the Pangeacene. <strong>Formed by photosynthetic box jellyfish only a few centimeters in size which have
                evolved to link together in floating colonies</strong>, they produce a biome which is, in effect, a
            floating reef that can extend for tens of miles. The jellies, <strong>which live in symbiosis with algae in
                their tissues</strong>, either feed only via passive filtration or have lost their digestive systems
            altogether, relying solely on their partners to provide them energy. Most jelly reefs develop as a thin,
            single layer of jellies, which an appearance a sheet of bubble wrap draped on the surface of the water, each
            bell containing a pocket of air for bouyancy. In very ideal conditions, however, the colonies may stack upon
            each other to depths of several inches. Fish shelter underneath the colonies for shelter from sea birds,
            feeding on microorganisms living within the colony or on the jellies themselves. Numerous large grazers feed
            on the edges, taking a significant toll on the reef and limiting its spread. <strong>Each individual jelly
                is neotenic, retaining the ability to bud off clones of itself</strong> even in its adult medusa state,
            and this is the manner in which the colony reproduces most often, <strong>able to to double itself in size
                in seven days under good conditions but functionally growing much less as it is constantly under assault
                from the actions of predatory fishes, sea mucks and invertebrates that gain sustenance by feeding on the
                reef.</strong> Flotsam in the form of floating seaweed, driftwood and feathers collect in the reefs over
            time, providing further hiding places and food sources for aquatic life. </p>
        <p>Because these "reefs" are entirely planktonic and at the mercy of the currents, they tend to collect in
            patches where numerous ocean currents meet, developing occasionally into massive refuges a hundred miles or
            more long in the middle of the ocean, like an oasis in the desert for marine life. They also readily wash
            ashore, sometimes in huge numbers, where the bells of the jellies deflate and leave the beach covered, for a
            time, in what appears to be thousands of gallons of snot. Unlike other jelly species, however,<strong> these
                beached colonies lack any harmful stings and are entirely harmless to the touch.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>The last of Serina's reef-like habitats is a rocky one</strong> formed by the distant descendants of
            <strong>freshwater pond snails which have largely adapted to fill the niches vacated following the nearly
                complete extinction of most bivalve groups at the end of the Thermocene</strong>. Some have then gone on
            and evolved into colonial filter-feeders much like Earth's coral and Serina's extinct stone-hydra before
            them. Each individual snail is typically only a few millimeters in length at adulthood and begins life as a
            planktonic, free-swimming larvae which immediately begins searching out a place to anchor itself with sticky
            threads and become sessile, their holdfasts eventually hardening into cement and locking them forever in
            their chosen location. <strong>Over time, large numbers of such snails will amass along the most favorable
                places</strong>, and as new generations adhere themselves to the shells of those which colonized the
            rock before them, <strong>over many centuries enormous stone reefs develop</strong>. Reef snails presumably
            evolved along rocky coasts, where they filtered food from turbulent crashing waters like clams, but today
            forms have also adapted to calmer tropical waters as a result of mutually beneficial symbiosis with algae
            carried in their tissues, as most reef organisms have evolved to do many times over history, both on Earth
            and Serina, and it is these species in their varied forms which produce the most notable and remarkable
            reefs home to countless colorful fishes and other animals. Like the chainjellies, such a relationship allows
            the reef snails to survive in nutrient-poor tropical waters. <strong>Nonetheless, the snails retain their
                digestive systems, emerging from their calcium shelters at night and extending feathery fan-shaped
                radulas into the water column to capture microscoptic plankton.</strong></p>
