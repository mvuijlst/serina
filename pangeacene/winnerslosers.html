        <h1>Winners and Losers in the Game of Life</h1>
        <p>It is hard to imagine a creature less like us than the little fork-tailed babbling jay, but though our lives
            and appearances are very different, there is no reason to suspect that the babbling jay was any less
            intelligent than we were. In response to harsh and changing environmental conditions, the jay adopted
            complex social systems, a spoken language, and tool use in order to survive. </p>
        <p>Unfortunately, no matter how bright it was, the babbling jay was a species crafted by evolution to survive in
            a single sort of habitat which was rapidly changing. The life-giving rains became more frequent and the
            environment formerly occupied by the babbling jay turned from scrubland to rainforest over several thousand
            years. <strong>Though the jay was behaviorally adaptable, it was poorly suited to survive against
                disease.</strong> Evolving in a very dry climate, it had evolved no resistance to bacteria and viral
            diseases that thrived in damp forests. The climate was changing. The desert it found refuge in was being
            claimed by grassland and rainforest, and <strong>as the climate became increasingly humid, the fork-tailed
                babbling jay's days were numbered.</strong></p>
        <p class="asterism">&#8258;</p>
        <p>The sapient fork-tailed babbling jay existed as a species for a very short time, just 4,000 years. However,
            it was virtually identical, except in behavior, to an earlier form of babbling jay which evolved ten
            thousand years earlier and split into three distinct populations. Their common ancestor was a desert bird,
            like the modern fork-tailed species, but two of its descendants split off roughly 8,000 years ago, moved
            northwards, and successfully adapted to wetter environments, giving rise to the black-breasted babbling jay
            and white-wing babbling jay. The fork-tailed babbling jay never truly left dry climates and adapted
            particularly and exclusively to the conditions present in the rainshadow desert. Unlike its relatives, this
            population never radiated further northwards, to gradually adapt to wetter climates. As the climate around
            it changed, the interior desert receded southwards and rainshadow desert which was once attached to it
            became an isolated strip of dry climate surrounded by forests. While it began a generalist and remained so
            behaviorally, it now evolved into a specialist in respect to a weak immune system owing to its relative
            isolation, which prevented its wider dispersal into other environs. As long as their small patch of habitat
            remained, the fork-tailed babbling jay's future was secure, but as the supercontinent of Serina continued to
            break apart and new weather patterns emerged, even the rainshadow desert eventually gave way to forests.
            Forest were not inherently problematic to the species so far as finding food, but in this case it would not
            be an inability to adapt behaviorally to change that would catch up to the babbling jay, but the ability to
            adapt physically in time. The babbling jay simply was not adapted to the different pathogens present in a
            tropical climate, and was unable to do so in the very brief span that the climate abruptly changed. A new
            seaway formed to the north, which introduced frequent torrential rains. <strong>In a matter of centuries,
                the entire desert climate shifted drastically, to one wet and humid - and very well-suited to
                pathogens.<br /></strong><br /> The fork-tailed babbling jay evolved to survive in an almost sterile
            environment with very few diseases. <strong>As the desert was displaced, the fork-tailed babbling jay
                suffered severe population crashes</strong> over several centuries as a result of several overlapping
            plagues of illness, namely a complex of aggressive pox viruses causing severe respiratory lesions and
            several strains of an aggressive bacteria which infected the digestive system, both spread by jungle birds.
            Though their numbers would recover for a while, they would never reach their former level before another
            wave of illness tore through the species like wildfire. Eventually, the species had too little genetic
            diversity to reproduce successfully and suffered fertility issues and birth defects, further compounding the
            problem. <strong>Within a very rapid time span, the species' population was left too broken up and the
                survivors too infertile to continue reproducing successfully, and the sapient babbling jay went
                extinct.</strong> It made no difference in the end how clever they were, when their bodies were simply
            unable to adapt in time to a rapid change of conditions.</p>
        <p>The more primitive population of less behaviorally complex babbling jays that gave rise to the three modern
            species had a stronger immune systems and were able to adapt to these disease-causing agents, while the more
            intelligent but highly desert-specialized fork-tailed form subsequently lost much of its immunity due to its
            isolation. It will never be known whether religion or mythology, as we know it in our own species, would
            ever have developed, or if there would ever be an advanced society of little jays one day, playing on little
            handheld computers allowing them to read pages just like this one. What wonderful things - or disastrous
            ones - would they have done if they had made it? Serina's global biosphere could have been devastated if the
            babbling jays were like us, or largely unaffected if they weren't. They could have one day colonized space,
            perhaps even seeding their own Serina-like world in the cosmos. <strong>They came closer to it than any
                other creature on Serina so far, but in the end they simply didn't get that far.</strong> In the end, we
            can only speculate on what could have been. </p>
        <p><strong>We can also only speculate on what life must have been like for the very last survivors.</strong>
            Having watched their families dwindle until they were all alone, the fear they must have felt is hard to
            imagine. It's probable a small number of individuals carried immunity to the pathogens, but as a result of
            the large population die offs became too isolated to find one another and stand any chance of recovery.
            Perhaps a few did for a time, but lacking new blood, soon produced groups too inbred to produce fertile
            eggs. <strong>As their habitat changed over to forest, their close relatives would have moved in along with
                it. Perhaps the last, lonely isolates of a doomed race took to joining the flock of other babbling jays
                for protection and some semblance of family.</strong> Perhaps the very last individual lived in such a
            way, as opposed to an even more lonely life of solitude. He may have joined a breeding pair as a helper,
            <strong>assisting in feeding their young, which look so much like his own yet never grow up quite
                right.</strong> He gives them names to which they never respond, learns their language but fails to
            teach them anything but the most fundamental aspects of his own. Perhaps he spends years in this state,
            adopted by animals so close to and yet so far from himself. They aren't much for conversation, but they are
            still there to snuggle against in the cold, dark nights and so he cherishes them dearly. <strong>Resigning
                to his fate, maybe he eventually takes one kind but simple-minded female as a mate</strong>, and so
            passes on the genes of his lineage one final time. <strong>Maybe all of the offspring he sires are like
                their mother, but long after he passes away, one of his hybrid grandchildren hatches with a similar to
                ability to think about the world around it, only to be taken by a predator before reaching
                independence.</strong> Whatever happened, the sapient babbling jay, and all of its potential, dies out
            with a whisper.</p>
        <p><strong>The more adaptable black-breasted and white-winged babbling jays not only survive to see the end of
                the Pangeacene, but will have produced descendants spread across the world within another few million
                years</strong>. However, none will ever again be subjected the exact conditions which led one population
            of their kind briefly to the level of sapience. Neither will their opposite counterparts, the
            <strong>bludgebirds</strong>, destined to remain static in their cognitive development for the next five
            million years, eventually to die out just as quietly as a result of changing climate and competition as well
            as predation from increasingly specialized pack-hunting predatory wheeljaws that will have become almost
            cosmopolitan across Serina by the time its super continent finally splits apart. </p>
        <p>The rise and fall of the sapient babbling jay is simultaneously fascinating and tragic, and demonstrates very
            well the fragility of all life. <strong>There are no creatures - no matter how large, abundant, or in this
                instance clever they may be - that are totally immune to extinction.</strong> Nature plays no favorites,
            and in this instance, the babbling jay's evolutionary bet didn't pay off. The conditions that led to their
            high intelligence also led to their being especially sensitive to disease agents common to different
            climates, and in the end, <strong>they lost the game of life.</strong> Just decades after the last
            fork-tailed babbling jay passes away, virtually any trace of their existence has vanished. All that remains
            are a few flint knives that can occasionally be found in the leaf litter of the forest, and a few faded,
            carved patterns in the trunks of a few old, dead trees. Within a few centuries, even these last relics are
            mostly unrecognizable, the last of their stone tools hidden under new layers of rich forest soil that have
            come to cover what was once the dry scrub, the trees themselves having fallen and broken down into it. </p>
        <p>In the span of evolutionary time upon which life operates, their existence at all was forged and finished in
            the blink of an eye, <strong>while life for the more fortunate goes on as we come to the end of the
                Pangeacene.</p>
