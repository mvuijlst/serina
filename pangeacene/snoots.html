        <h1>Snoots</h1>
        <p><strong>Snoots</strong> are a family of terrestrial <strong>bumblets</strong> which, though still burrowers,
            <strong>find much of their food above ground</strong>. They are plodding, awkward creatures which shuffle
            along low to the ground, <strong>walking on their highly enlarged wrists which make up most of their
                forearm,</strong> but even so they are far more agile over land than their ancestors. Their wrists have
            become better suited to walking than in the ancestral bumblet, <strong>sitting almost directly under the
                body with weight born only on the tips rather than across the whole palm</strong>, and so snoots can
            properly move with relative agility rather than be restricted to the frantic sea-turtle locomotion of
            earlier forms. Snoots are therefore able to amble at a decent pace as they search for food - a <strong>diet
                which is more varied than other bumblets </strong>and includes fruit, seeds, and greens in addition to
            invertebrate prey - in the undergrowth with their long, sensitive bills, much like an avian hedgehog.
            <strong>They are nonetheless still slow and ungainly runners</strong>, however, with the large paddle-like
            wrists still being much more suited to digging, and <strong>rely on defense rather than flight </strong>for
            protection; like a hedgehog's quills, <strong>the feathers on their backs have elongated into an armor of
                sharp prickly spines</strong> which serve as a predator defense and readily detach if their owner is
            agitated. </p>
        <figure><img alt="snoots" src="images/jR8JXkI.jpg" style="width:100%" />
            <figcaption><strong>above:</strong> a pair of snoots scout the surroundings of their burrow entrance on the
                plains north of the arid interior for danger. Seeing only a harmless, vegetarian circuagodont grazing
                just beyond their den, they determine it is safe to emerge and forage for food in the puffgrass.
            </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Nesting underground, snoots are monogames and pairs work together to maintain a burrow year round for both
            reproductive and roosting purposes. <strong>Their young are born defenseless and underdeveloped</strong>
            like other terrestrial bumblets, and do not venture above ground for four months; they spend a further year
            and a half with their parents, often assisting in the rearing of the next seasons' young before moving out
            onto their own to begin their own families.</p>
        <p>The snoot's eyes are large and have become important to scout for danger, <strong>redeveloping from the
                reduced state of their ancestors</strong>. Like the snuffles, however, <strong>eons in the dark have
                left them color blind</strong>, and their eyesight remains secondary in importance to their especially
            <strong>keen sense of smell </strong>which both leads them to food and alerts them to predators.</p>
