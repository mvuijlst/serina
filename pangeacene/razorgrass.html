        <h1>Razorgrasses</h1>
        <p><strong>Razorgrasses</strong> are a new clade of <strong>spreading, perennial plant of the cactus-like
                sunflower lineage</strong>, which have convergently evolved a grass-like appearance with creeping
            horizontal stems and thin, blade-like leaves. Having evolved in the hot interior of the new supercontinent
            roughly ten million years ago from a less vigorous bush-like ancestor, they are notable for sporting
            <strong>extraordinarily sharp leaf blades and stems embedded with very high concentrations of
                silica</strong> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phytolith" rel="nofollow"
                target="_blank">phytoliths</a>. Many true grasses already incorporate silica into their tissues as a
            defense against grazers and have done so for hundreds of millions of years - indeed, Earth animals such as
            elephants which lose and regrow teeth throughout their lives have developed such adaptations specifically in
            response to the destructive effect this mineral has on their teeth. Razorgrass, however, deposits them not
            simply within its leaves but also as <strong>a dense covering of microscopic barbs over all of its
                tissues</strong> that makes them highly unpalatable and additionally served <strong>effectively to guard
                against evaporation in the hot, arid climate</strong> of the interior desert where they originated. In
            recent millennia the new smaller and spreading razorgrasses have <strong>crept out from the desert and begun
                establishing in more equatorial regions, aided by airborne seeds that can spread far and wide on the
                breeze, and displacing more palatable plains vegetation such as true grasses and clovers</strong>. This
            has had a negative effect on the ranges of the serezelles and other grazing birds reliant on these food
            sources, pushing them northwards.</p>
        <p>Like the assassin grasses before them, but for a very different reason, razorgrasses are unpalatable as a
            food source. Whereas assassin grasses produced toxic chemical agents, <strong>it is the physical nature of
                the razorgrass that makes it hard to consume - quite literally</strong>. Heavily armored as it has
            become with mineral deposits, <strong>regular consumption is highly destructive to the toothless bills of
                grazing birds</strong>, literally sanding off the ridges required to grasp and process plant foods and
            in extreme cases filing down the keratin of the beak down to the underlying bone. Furthermore birds such as
            the serezelles are unable to chew, meaning that in order to break down their food they must swallow it and
            process it in their gizzards, a method which is effective enough with most foods but <strong>with the thin,
                brittle, and knife-like blades of razorgrass can result in physical injury.</strong> Razorgrass rapidly
            takes over grasslands in dry climates, proliferating into dense, dangerous mats of sharp blades during the
            dry season when actual grasses must go dormant. Though serezelles can manage to consume small quantities of
            razorgrass foliage during the wetter seasons, when it dies back substantially and is deprived of sunlight by
            the the choking growth of the true grasses, <strong>a diet of exclusively such as is often all that's
                available during the rest of the year results in starvation.</strong> As their bill is worn down and
            becomes raw and the esophagus suffers numerous cuts and abrasions, <strong>feeding becomes painful and the
                animal wastes away before the rains return</strong>. Areas where rainfall is reliable throughout the
            year, such as across the equator, are not suitable for colonization by razorgrasses but also typically
            support only short-lived grasslands at best, for these environments are rapidly invaded by the seedlings of
            trees and eventually give way to shaded forests. It is these forests - which the serezelles originally
            evolved out of - that may soon become their final refuge as the grassland environment is altered drastically
            by this new invasive species.</p>
        <p>Razorgrass is unpalatable to all birds and is also very rarely eaten by insects - <strong>even leaf-cutting
                ants struggle to trim it</strong>. There is a group of animals that are able to process it, however, a
            group which can lay claim to one thing the grazing birds have not: <strong>teeth.</strong></p>
