        <h1>A World with Fewer Flowers</h1>
        <p>Bright, colorful flowers of the types that humans would recognize have been much less abundant in general
            since the Thermocene-Pangeacene boundary brought many representative plant clades to extinction. Grasses
            still dominate most of Serina's drier regions, virtually all of which have insignificant wind-pollinated
            flowers. Many flowering trees in wetter climates have likewise exhibited a trend toward the shrinking of
            their flowers and consolidation of their parts into small clusters hidden close to their stems. Dandelions,
            which were already wind-dispersed, have given rise to many descendants that use the breeze to pollinate
            their flowers in the manner of the grasses and have subsequently lost their petals. It is so that since the
            start of the Pangeacene, Serina is a less colorful world.</p>
        <p>Of the flamboyant blossoms you are still likely to see, most are very likely to originate from two clades -
            <strong>clovers</strong>, one the last more or less totally insect-pollinated plant groups in existence,
            which are most abundant in the form of low-growing prairie plants worldwide and as bushes and small trees in
            temperate climates, and an aberrant clade of grasses known as <strong>grandifloragrams</strong> (roughly
            translating to large-flowered grasses). Grandifloragrams, which include <strong>chokeweed</strong> and
            <strong>nanboo</strong> as their extant members, are a widespread family of specialized grasses which
            evolved in the Tempuscene and are notable for having large, colorful bracts surrounded their flowers,
            producing nectar to attract animal pollinators, and producing fleshy fruits or seed pods rather than loose
            seeds borne on stalks. Unlike all other grasses, plants of this ancient and diverse family rely on animals -
            not wind - to fertilize their flowers, and it is almost ironic that they are today one of only a few plant
            clades left which operate by this method of reproduction. Most recruit insects to do the job, but the large
            forest-forming representatives of the group known as nanboos - a group of grandiflorigrams allied by
            producing large psuedostems from underground rhizomes - rely almost entirely on birds and tribbets, with
            very large blossoms full of nectar.</p>
        <p>Because there are fewer suitable flowers on Serina in the Pangeacene than before, there are fewer groups of
            specialist pollinating insects to service them. Ants are still major players, and since the extinction of
            the formerly diverse pollinating crickets, the <strong>florgusts</strong>, at the end of the Thermocene only
            one other group of insect has produced any specialist pollinator lineages. This would be the
            <strong>beetles</strong>, which have produced one clade of agile flyers with highly elongated proboscis that
            feed mainly on the nectar of nanboo, the only insects which can readily access it deep inside these plants'
            very large blossoms. </p>
        <p>In the deserts of Serina in the Pangeacene things are a little different. Conditions are dry, and plants of a
            given species are often greatly spaced out, making wind pollination unreliable. Indeed, it was in this very
            type of environment that the first grandiflorigrams so long evolved in the Tempuscene, and many other plants
            here have similarly retained a dependence on animal pollinators and large blossoms to attract them.
            Sunflower trees such as the desert <strong>puddlebuds</strong>, for example retain small daisy-like
            blossoms, even though their woodland relatives have lost them, and leafless cactus-like species produce very
            large flowers after rainfall which attract not only insects but also birds and tribbats. Members of other
            groups that inhabit deserts such as dandelions also retain colorful flowers.</p>
