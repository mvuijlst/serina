        <h1>Trees of the Pangeacene</h1>
        <p><strong>Myrmecophytes</strong> - broadly known as <strong>ant trees</strong> - have seen a resurgence as the
            dominant floral group making up the forests of the Pangeacene. Descended from sunflower trees and with no
            biological relationship to the original bamboo trees which first developed the mutually beneficial
            relationship, they adopted it as a result of their competition in order to defend themselves from other
            trees whose ant colonies would attempt to mow down all other plant growth in the vicinity of their hosts,
            unless those hosts could defend themselves. While some of their relatives, the <strong>gluetrap
                trees</strong>, instead developed sticky ant-smothering sap to protect their assets from injury, the
            easiest solution for other sunflowers was simply to accommodate their own ant colonies to limit the damage
            inflicted on them by those allied to neighboring trees. They developed similar hollow galls in their tissues
            to accommodate nests, and in some cases nectar-producing glands to provide a ready food source, to attract
            their own lodgers. Over the eons, <strong>these copycats would come to displace the original bamboo
                trees</strong>, which were afflicted heavily by the evolution of <strong>assassin grasses</strong> in
            the Thermocene which overtook large tracts of formerly forest habitat by inhibiting the survival of most
            tree seedlings. By chance, it would be a member of the sunflower tree lineage which first developed an
            immunity to the toxins produced by assassin grasses and was able to rise above them and shade them out,
            restoring forest communities. The tree in question was of the gluetrap lineage, and lacked ant partners. By
            beginning the chain of forest succession, however, it cleansed the land of assassin grasses (which die in
            shaded conditions) and allowed the subsequent growth of less resistant plants, including mymercophyte
            sunflowers. Before the evolution of assassin grass and gluetrap trees, it was the bamboo ant trees which had
            specialized as pioneer species, the first to grow on cleared land and start the development of the forest
            community - like assassin grass, they required full sun to grow and survive, and their seedling could not
            survive in the understory of an established woodland. So displaced as they now were by gluetrap trees that
            even following the decline of assassin grasses, there was little room left for their group. The extreme
            ecological upheaval at the end of the Thermocene, which resulted in the nearly complete loss of forests
            worldwide, <strong>was the final nail in the coffin for a once widely diverse group of trees, but was only
                the final factor following tens of millions of years of drawn-out decline. </strong></p>
        <p><strong>The sole survivors among tree-like plants</strong>, excluding the extremely specialized marine bamboo
            which were by this time only trees in the broadest sense, descended from woody plants but now more akin to
            seaweed - <strong>were only a handful of sunflower species</strong>. Some of them were mymercophytes and
            utilized ants to trim away competitors and to spread their seeds. On the other spectrum, at least one
            species was a gluetrap tree which defended itself from said ants with sticky insect-snagging sap. It is
            these few trees, apparently all ancestrally tropical, which have given rise to most of the broad-leafed
            trees of the Pangeacene - thousands of endemic species worldwide. In the impoverished environment of the
            early Pangeacene, ant trees were extremely successful, employing their insect lodgers with the task of
            trimming back the leaves of any neighboring plants to maximize the amount of sunlight that could reach those
            of their hosts. This behavior evolved long ago in herbivorous, leaf-cutting species which would use the
            foliage of their neighboring trees to raise fungi, which they fed on. Most symbiotic ants of the Pangeacene,
            however, are more generalized. They still harvest the leaves they take and use them to raise fungal gardens
            which they harvest and feed to their larvae, but as adults they also feed on other insects, simultaneously
            keeping their host trees free of both insect pests and plant competitors. Additionally, <strong>the inner
                linings of the galls the trees produce to attract nesting ants absorb the nutrients deposited within
                them by the ants' droppings and partially consumed food remnants and the decomposing plant material
                utilized by the ants to cultivate the fungus they feed to their larvae.</strong> By associating with the
            tree, the ant is provided safety and a ready supply of food - so long as it does not consume its own host,
            but only neighboring plants, which the ants can distinguish by scent even among the same species. By
            attracting the ant, the tree benefits from the processing of the insect pests and plant competitors which
            would otherwise harm it into organic matter it can use to fertilize its own growth. <strong>The system
                remains highly beneficial to both plant and animal and lives on</strong>, even though the original
            bamboo trees which began the process have long since died out, survived only by the sunflower trees which,
            initially, were the very unwelcome competitors they employed the ants to attack in the first place. </p>
        <p>Like the most derived bamboo trees, <strong>many ant trees rely on their partners to disperse their
                seeds</strong>. Seeding is timed with the production of fertile queens and drones within a colony,
            and<strong> each queen takes with her a seed when she flies off to start a new colony</strong>. Colonies
            start in the ground, where the queen buries the seed, but with luck, within a year it will be underneath the
            roots of a growing seedling. <strong>As the tree grows, the colony expands above ground</strong> and moves
            into the hollow chambers and galls produced in the tree's tissues, often channeling out highways just
            underneath the bark that stretch from the roots to the tops of the tree. Through these channels the ants
            cart food and leave droppings absorbed by the plant, in addition to a very large source of nutrients
            deposited in the underground nest chamber which the tree surrounds with fine feeding roots. </p>
        <p><strong>Sunflower trees are not the only tree-like plants around</strong> by 40 million years into the
            Pangeacene, however. In drier and colder regions where competition is much lower, <strong>myrmecophytes are
                less successful and other plant groups lacking either an insect-repellent sap or their own ant armies
                have been able to establish a hold</strong>, producing large tree-like forms. In the arid interior,
            these are the <strong>cactus sunflowers</strong>, related only distantly to the broad-leafed trees. Many
            species of them lack leaves altogether and grow only as of branching, thorny, water-filled photosynthesizing
            stems, some of them reaching heights of fifty feet or more - resembling a leafless broad leaf tree all year
            long. Others grow flushes of leaves seasonally, replacing them with sharp thorns after the brief rainy
            season to prevent desiccation, while a few groups retain their leaves all year long, covering them in a
            thick armor of hard silica; it is from this group, comprised mostly of desert bushes and small scrubby
            trees, <strong>that the creeping razorgrasses evolved. </strong></p>
        <p>On the plains and at high altitudes, <strong>dandelions</strong> regularly give rise to large and sometimes
            branching forms which could be considered trees of a type, though more akin to palms than anything else.
            <strong>On mountains, these are often the most noticeable endemics, swelling to massive sizes with large
                fuzzy leaves which insulate against the cold and airborne seeds that disperse via cottony threads on the
                wind</strong>, as they have now done for hundreds of millions of years. Dandelions are a plant group
            which seems very capable of producing large tree-like forms and have started on that path repeatedly
            throughout Serina's history, but never to their fullest potential, because they are always slightly less
            competitive than the other plants around them. In a world without sunflowers or bamboo, <strong>the
                dandelion would surely be the dominant forest-producing plant</strong>, but so far, most species must be
            content as smaller bushes and extremists, reaching their greatest sizes only where their competitors
            struggle to grow. <strong>Hardiness is certainly one factor they have going for them</strong>, the group as
            a whole being extremely tolerant to sandy and rocky soils low in nutrients and blazing direct sunlight -
            indeed, like bamboo, they struggle to survive in shaded conditions, particularly when first establishing.
            Dandelions thrive in the arid interior as a variety of scrubby bushes and daisy-like flowers which spend
            most of the year as dormant roots, bursting into bloom for only a short period whenever the rains fall. Some
            species have swollen leaves in which they store water, resembling aloes. </p>
