        <h2>The Land</h2>
        <p>All of Serina's eight major landmasses have now come together <strong>to form a single
                supercontinent</strong>. <strong>South Anciska, Wahlteria, </strong><strong>Stehvlandea</strong> and
            <strong>Karii </strong>have completely joined around the <strong>Kyran Islands</strong>. Most interior
            seaways between the continents have drained away completely, with several large freshwater lakes having
            developed in the last remnants where they once occurred. The last seaways remaining occur between
            <strong>Striata </strong>and <strong>Wahlteria</strong>, but these two have begun to recede. One stretch of
            sea cuts eastward about halfway to the east coast, while another still exists opposite to it connecting to
            the east coast. <strong>North Anciska </strong>has collided with the supercontinent over the past forty
            million years, the full extent of its attachment still obscured by the aforementioned eastern seaway which
            sits right at its attachment junction, flooding all but a thin land bridge between the two continental
            plates. <strong>Polar Anciska </strong>has also recently collided as it moved in a north and eastward
            clockwise arc, now attaching to Striata on the opposite coast from its long-lost more southerly
            counterparts, which began over 200 million years ago as a single continent in Serina's west.
            <strong>Borea</strong> has moved west but retained a polar location, its islands having weathered
            substantially more over the past eons to a fraction of their former size.</p>
        <p>The global climate remains relatively mild, <strong>but is cooler than through most of the
                Thermocene</strong>, particularly toward the southern hemisphere. Currently there are no permanent ice
            caps, but glacial periods have occurred several times in the last several million years during which they
            have formed only to recede again. Seasonal snowfall occurs in polar regions, though the south pole is
            extremely dry, with extremely limited precipitation. Equatorial regions, however, are hot and humid towards
            the coasts, with rainforest common toward the equator. <strong>The climate of the lower portion of the
                supercontinent, however, is dry and arid, with an enormous interior desert taking up much of the
                southern hemisphere.</strong> Large seasonal grasslands border the dry interior, where temperatures
            reach extremes of both heat and cold. Here plant life is limited and in some regions virtually absent, with
            the vast majority of biodiversity in this era occurring along the outer edges of the continent in the
            savannahs and broadleaf forests toward the poles and in the northern hemisphere. Coastal regions near the
            south pole are less arid than more inland locales and are able to support a greater diversity of plant life,
            but harsh temperatures limit these environments largely to taiga and tundra ecosystems, absent in the milder
            north. Moving towards the equator, the coastal forest belt expands into large tracts of temperate broadleaf
            forest, with the east coast of the supercontinent in particular experiencing extremes of rainfall which
            combined with relatively mild winters and long growing season<strong> have allowed for the evolution of some
                of the tallest trees ever to exist</strong>. Moving north along the east coast, the climate stays
            equally wet but becomes tropical, forming a huge continuous tract of tropical forest on the moon from coast
            to coast along the equator, a hub for biodiversity. Some parts of this forest is true rainforest, while in
            others a <strong>seasonal tropical woodland</strong> biome predominately, where trees may lose their leaves
            in the heat of summer to escape drought, returning to life in the rainy season. All of the northern
            landmasses are dominated by temperate woodland and grasslands with clearly distinguished cool winter and hot
            or mild summers. </p>
        <p>It is the southern interior desert which experiences Serina's most extreme temperatures in this era, both of
            hot and cold; highs approaching 120 degrees Fahrenheit and winter lows of -30 degrees are not unusual.
            Conditions in the north are conversely much more mild, with winter temperatures even on the northernmost
            land of Borea barely reaching 0 degrees Fahrenheit, but even this far-isolated land sees high summer
            temperatures and lush forests fueled by high rainfall, kept warmer by a lower elevation than the south pole
            and warm oceanic currents.</p>
        <h2>The Life</h2>
        <p>Life on the new supercontinent is now diverse and varied. <strong>Tribbetheres</strong> and multiple lineages
            of birds have simultaneously given rise to charismatic megafauna, but there are general trends in regards to
            which groups do what most effectively. Carnivorous tribbetheres have experienced a boom in diversity and
            have proven successful broadening their diets into both omnivorous and predominately herbivorous leanings,
            though as predators they are most significant, filling these niches across the supercontinent. <strong>More
                basal species give rise to a highly successful group of rodent analogues, which utilize a unique mortar
                and pestle-like jaw design made possible by their specialized extensible jaws to grind open nuts and
                seeds.</strong> A third group of primitive tribbetheres become arboreal insectivores, becoming the first
            group outside introduced insects and canaries to <strong>develop powered flight</strong> as they leap and
            glide to catch prey with extended patagia of skin on their arms. </p>
        <p>Among birds, the cold-blooded or mesothermic mucks have been largely relegated toward small or specialized
            niches after a short period of experimentation as megafauna at the start of the era, but survive in larger
            forms in the tropics. Among all surviving birds, <strong>snuffles</strong> initially seemed to be one of the
            best suited to terrestrial radiation if the history of similar animals on the Kyran Islands were any
            indication, but likely owing to their aquatic specialty, have not produced large terrestrial species or
            expanded far out of their mainly carnivorous diets, though are nonetheless very widespread and successful in
            riparian environments where they continue on as they have for so long in primitive forms. Instead, the big
            herbivore niches among birds are filled predominately by a group that would likely not be anticipated: the
            highly specialized <strong>changelings.</strong> </p>
        <p><strong>Changelings</strong> remain the most successful of all Pangeacene birds by numbers of species and
            have displaced many other bird groups to make following their extinction at the Thermocene-Pangeacene
            boundary, from which they were likely spared as a result of their more adaptable juvenile period and higher
            potential reproductive output. The last "primitive" flying birds are members of the ancient waterfowl-like
            group descended from the Hypostecene <strong>galliwalts</strong>, which now lived over 200 million years
            ago, and a clade of seabirds which descend from a single gull-like survivor species. Perhaps due to their
            relatively specialized lifestyles, these particular groups are not in decline and make up roughly 10% of
            modern flighted bird diversity. The other <strong>90% of flying birds, however, are changelings</strong>,
            which have moved into a wide variety of niches in adulthood, including <strong>virtually all inland
                generalist, seed-eating, pollinator, and predatory niches</strong> which were once filled by more
            primitive lineages. Changelings have further monopolized niches from wholly unrelated animal groups
            including many beetles and certain fishes in their immature life stages, which <strong>some groups having
                even become neotenic and now able to mate without ever maturing into a flying adul</strong>t or maturing
            at an intermediate stage. A side-effect of adapting as larvae which has greatly aided them in radiating into
            a broader range of niches than was possible for ancestral bird groups was the ability to move along using
            their underdeveloped wings in their juvenile life stages. T<strong>his allowed for the evolution of the
                necessary musculature to retain the forearms as walking limbs in adults</strong>, rather than to
            re-purpose them as wings. The first such birds retained wing claws to climb and grip, then to support
            weight. Members of such intermediate stages which were able to put weight on their arms while still
            retaining flight specializations were able to develop a quadrupedal launch similar to that of pterosaurs,
            <strong>greatly increasing their potential size while still able to fly far beyond what was possible in a
                biped.</strong></p>
        <p>In some other groups the <strong>walking limbs eventually became wholly useless as wings</strong>, losing
            their patagia and specialized arrangement of flight feathers and becoming longer, to brachiate, climb, or
            even run on the open plains. These quadrupedal specialists, as they became larger than was ideally suited to
            metamorphosis (<strong>at such great sizes, the process of development from one form to the next would be
                too ungainly and prolonged</strong>), experienced a r<strong>eversion of their prolonged larval life
                stage</strong>. Their solution, having already lost the need for a calcified eggshell, <strong>was to
                hatch their young internally and allow them to mature inside the parent,</strong> nourished by a
            placenta-like structure, through a hastened, vestigial larval stage, then a lengthy period of growth and
            development from a superficially primitive bird-like fetus into whatever increasingly specialized form it
            would have as an adult. The young would then be born alive in varying stages of development depending on
            their niche - fast-running plains herbivores would retain their young longer, so that they could run from
            predators shortly after birth, like ungulates, while more primitive forms would need to raise their young
            for more prolonged periods in sheltered locations as they developed, such as occurs in Earth primates,
            rodents, or carnivores. Modern quadrupedal changelings were not the first birds to respond to the ecological
            vacuum after the extinction event and radiate as large herbivores - <strong>the very first were in fact
                large and ratite-like primitive waterfowl, which declined only in recent time as a direct result of
                their competition.</strong> Today, however,among birds changelings dominate such niches almost
            exclusively, the only other birds to also still have some surviving large, non-flying herbivorous forms
            being the mucks, and with these in noticeable decline versus their former diversity. </p>
        <p>Among flightless birds, however, there are more generalized and carnivorous survivors, not so much in the
            form of the large "terror-birds" which dominated Serina's ecosystems for so long, but especially in smaller
            forms and in aquatic and riparian environments. Snuffles - coincidentally, one of just three bird lineages
            left which still incubate hard-shelled eggs in nests (along with surviving waterfowl and seabirds) - are
            widespread but primitive; <strong>bumblets</strong> have also become cosmopolitan, and furthermore have
            moved into several new niches. In several respects, these ancestral burrowers have much in common with
            advanced changelings: both are capable of walking on all four legs and retain their young in their bodies,
            not laying external eggs. Bumblets - even though warm-blooded and active - have sprawled forearms, however,
            and are incapable of an upright gait; they are thus slower and more ungainly. Their reproduction is simpler
            as well, with underdeveloped chicks being born immediately after hatching from soft-shelled eggs inside the
            mother's womb and requiring a prolonged period of care, and works much more effectively for smaller animals
            which dwell in burrows for protection, which is what all bumblets still do at least to breed. <strong>The
                ancestral burrowing survivor species has by now given rise to a number of larger forms which spend more
                of their time above ground</strong>, including species that counteract their handicaps in agility by
            being armored or conversely, covered in quills that dissuade attacks by predators and have expanded from a
            carnivorous diet to an omnivorous one. <strong>Others become more aquatic and begin to feed more in the
                water</strong>, the start of such behavior already shown in species from forty million years ago. Their
            ability to flood their oviducts with oxygen increases, <strong>allowing pregnant females to dive while
                retaining their soft-shelled eggs until they hatch.</strong> Oceanic species and waterside ambush
            predators have resulted, but they are inhibited from becoming totally aquatic like the whalebirds of times
            gone by the underdeveloped state of their chicks - <strong>they return to land to give birth and tend their
                young.</strong></p>
        <p>Changelings, however, do not have any such restrictions, and <strong>produce large aquatic forms both as
                derived adults and neotenic larvae</strong>. Even tribbets, which only left the water for the first time
            comparably recently, <strong>return to aquatic niches multiple times</strong>, both from more reptillian and
            tribbetherian ancestors.</p>
        <p>Invertebrates evolved just as quickly as their larger counterparts to their post-extinction world.
            <strong>Ants are thriving with the second wave of ant forests</strong>, with levels of diversity unseen
            since the Cryocene. <strong>Land crabs</strong> begin to displace many crickets and arachnids, becoming
            increasingly abundant in drier terrestrial environments. Those pollinating crickets, the
            <strong>florgusts</strong> may be gone, but their line has not completely terminated; they have left behind
            descendants in the form of predatory, neotenic centipede-like forms which descend from a caterpillar-like
            larvae that has ceased to molt into a flying adult. To replace their lost adult niche, a group of colorful
            beetles with sucking mouth-parts and showy wings arise to take advantage of the vacancy, but they have
            competition again from the changelings, one group of which has become exceedingly small in adulthood,
            producing the smallest birds ever to live, some of which specialize to feed on nectar. One lineage further
            specializes into insect-like <i>eusocial colonies</i>, where infertile adult workers raise the offspring of
            a <strong>single breeding queen which never fully matures</strong> and exists solely as a blind, featherless
            egg-producing machine with a disconcerting amalgam of fetal avian and grub-like attributes. Other more
            primitive changelings became fly-like, laying their eggs opportunistically in carcasses or open wounds
            rather than producing larders in nests. It was not a great leap from there to true parasitism, and
            <strong>forms by this period exist which lay their eggs in the bodies of other animals and spend their
                larval periods as parasites, feeding from the flesh of their hosts before maturing into adult
                birds.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Some changelings whose young mature in water have been able to cut their ties to the land completely,
                and may never land after fledging</strong>. Like swifts, they are agile flyers who pursue a nomadic
            lifestyle of chasing insects on the wing. Unlike swifts which have to land to rear their eggs, though, these
            birds need devote no more time to parenthood than skimming over the surface of a pool or river and releasing
            a sticky mass of tiny eggs into the water, to mature entirely on their own. Breeding, feeding, drinking -
            via a similar skimming motion - and even sleeping on the wing, in adulthood they become the most truly
            air-born of all creatures.</p>
        <p>At sea, extremely derived <strong>neotenic, aquatic changeling birds crawl and squirm</strong>, feeding on
            detritus or ambushing prey on the sea bottom. One group which evolved to develop its eyes early on now even
            competes directly with fishes, having become a highly mobile, agile swimmer propelled by a muscular
            streamlined body and fluked tail. Living in a world of fishes which - as descendants of guppies and
            swordtails - predominately give live birth, <strong>it has ended up being a <i>bird</i> which reproduces by
                spawning thousands of tiny eggs at sea. The "birds" then spend their first few months floating as
                zooplankton, before growing large enough to form free-swimming shoals.</strong> They are perhaps the
            most extreme example of regression in all the animal kingdom; many land-animals, descended from fishes,
            return to the sea. Some even become secondarily fish-like in form, but none come close to the nearly perfect
            replication of their ancestors as can be seen in such changelings. </p>
        <p><strong>Reefs have recovered in a stable sea</strong>, this time formed by the blind, tentacle-mouthed,
            filter-feeding descendants of <strong>freshwater snails.</strong> </p>
        <p><strong>Jellyfish</strong> experienced a boom in the harsh seas of the Thermocene-Pangeacene boundary, one of
            the only groups to come through the event relatively well. One of the most successful groups diverged at
            this time are tiny, highly reduced <strong>photosynthetic box jellies</strong> which have lost completely
            their arms, eyes, and feeding organs. They now float in the open seas across the world, from poles to
            tropical coastal waters, living on sunlight and nutrients they absorb passively from the water alone and
            adhering to one another in first chains, then clumps which come eventually to form massive mats over the
            surface <strong>to provide welcome food and refuge to fishes and other aquatic life in waters too deep for
                conventional reefs to develop.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Bamboo</strong> nearly became extinct at the Thermocene-Pangeacene boundary after a long decline, but
            survives as a single lineage, the completely aquatic sea bamboos. Bangroove forests survived right up until
            the middle of the Thermocene-Pangeacene boundary, but eventually succumbed to the extreme conditions
            affecting the equatorial regions where they prospered. Sunflowers are now the most dominant forest-producing
            plant group. <strong>Pineflower</strong> trees did not make it, however. They died at the boundary like so
            many other groups, their temperate biomes shrinking up the faces of mountains until they could no longer
            take the rising heat and perished. <strong>Hardy cactus-like groups did make it through the extinction
                event</strong>, some of the only plants which managed to survive the extremes of heat and cold away from
            the south pole and among the first to spread out when conditions began to recover only to be mostly
            out-competed by forests along coastal regions and in the north as soon as temperatures cooled. Today they
            still thrive throughout the dry interior, where little else can. Grasses continue to dominate the
            intermediate regions, too dry for forests but too wet to become deserts. Sea bamboo forms dense underwater
            meadows in shallow coastal waters across the world, home to myriad specialized aquatic herbivores and
            providing refuge to countless small fishes and invertebrates.</p>
        <p><strong>Assassin grasses</strong> have died out in their ancestral niche completely and largely fallen into
            obscurity, but have given rise to a group of tree-like plants which still hold on in a variety of harsh
            climates worldwide, where sunflower trees don't do well, including along the salty shore of the ocean, the
            borders of deserts, and cold mountain slopes. They are aided by herbicides produced in their roots which
            prevent competitors from growing nearby them, but <strong>this also leaves them highly dependent on animal
                dispersers for their seeds to find new places to take root</strong>. Coastal forms use crabs, and it is
            surely because of this association that at least one group of land crabs began moving so rapidly inland, as
            they followed their host trees. The assassin grass tree has declined considerably in the last twenty million
            years, however, <strong>coincidentally following the time frame over which the specialized seed-eating
                tribbetheres evolved</strong>. It is likely that the trees did not evolve with any seed-eating predators
            before this time, with the exception of the crabs that dispersed their seeds by burying them in shallow
            caches. The tribbetheres grind them up and eat them, and any they stash may be buried at deeper depths than
            the tree has adapted to be able to sprout from, for it sprouts from a tiny seed and cannot at that time
            reach the surface from depths of more than an inch or two. It has thus since been pushed to the extreme
            edges of the environment, where tribbetheres are less abundant, but also where - except at the sea coast -
            its mutualistic crabs cannot survive. Interestingly, though, <strong>the crabs have adapted apparently
                without issue to new diets and remain abundant in inland forests long since abandoned by their former
                host</strong> as a diverse group of small arboreal herbivores.</p>
        <p>Serina has never been a more alien place than it has become 40 million years into the Pangeacene.</p>
