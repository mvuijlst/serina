        <h1>Molodonts of the Late Pangeacene</h1>
        <p><strong>Molodonts</strong> continue to thrive into the late Pangeacene. Forms have adapted to virtually all
            environments, from the far polar regions to hot deserts, and from the open plains and deep into forests.
            Protected from the elements by a dense fur coat, they thrive where other tribbets cannot. Molodonts have
            some of the most well-developed brains of all tribbets and are almost all social to some degree. Though
            their mortar-and-pestle like jaws are best suited to process hard nuts and seeds, the design is in fact
            quite versatile and molodonts have now evolved not only into a widely successful clade of rodent-like
            animals but also into large herbivores, generalists, and even carnivores, all through small modifications to
            the shape of their teeth. Though in all forms the dentition is highly specialized, with only two teeth in
            the jaw, the form of these teeth varies considerably. Species which feed mainly on nuts have a large blocky
            upper incisor which simply smashes food against a horizontally-flattened plate-like lower tooth. Species
            which feed more heavily on plant foods often develop a wedge-shaped upper tooth, adapted to cut in front and
            grind in back, which reaches its extreme in the grazing cirguagodonts, with the front of their teeth coming
            together in a slicing motion like a pair of pruning shears. The front of other molodont's teeth form a
            chisel, suited to gnawing into the bark of trees in search of insect prey or to construct a nest. In
            predatory forms, the teeth have both become serrated, cutting like kitchen shears in front and slicing
            chunks of flesh in the rear.</p>

            <figcaption><strong>above:</strong> a plump marmot-like molodont emerges in search of food from its burrow
                in temperate North Anciska, as winter gives way to the first new green growth of spring.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Tribbetheres in general, but especially molodonts, are also successful as a result of the high degree of care
            they lavish upon their offspring. Though some species are K-strategists and other r-strategists, all protect
            and nurture their young for at least a few weeks before they are independent. Indeed, it is the result of a
            prolonged period of parental attention that has allowed the molodont its high degree of dental
            specialization. The offspring are initially born completely toothless and are fed a pre-chewed mash of food
            by one or more of their parents for as long as several months before ever beginning to eat solid foods,
            giving them ample time to develop their teeth. The time from birth to weaning is shortest in small
            rodent-like seed-eaters, lasting about three weeks, and longest in large circuagodonts, whose highly
            specialized teeth are not sufficiently developed to allow them to feed themselves for up to six months. </p>
        <p>By the late Pangeacene, there are approximately 700 living species of molodont tribbetheres, ranging from
            small grainivores no larger than mice to circuagodonts weighing more than two thousand pounds. Through them,
            the tribbetheres have almost completely claimed many niches formerly occupied by highly specialized birds
            groups, particularly in regards to large terrestrial herbivores and burrowers. Their future in an
            ever-changing world - particularly a colder one - is for now very bright. Their active metabolism,
            insulating integument, and the ability of many small forms to estivate or hibernate through harsh conditions
            will truly give the "fishes" an edge on land in coming eons.</p>
