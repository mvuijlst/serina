        <figure><img alt="three babbling jays" src="images/yAkjpf4.png" />
            <figcaption><strong>above:</strong> three adult fork-tailed babbling jays perched on a desert tree, each
                holding in its bill a small stone cutting implement.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>The <strong>fork-tailed babbling jay</strong> is a small magpie-like perching bird, with a handsome orange,
            black and white plumage and a long, deeply forked tail. It belongs to a widespread, very recently evolved
            family of corvid-like sparrowgulls which have spread across Serina from the dry interior desert northwards
            in the last one million years. Specifically, it is the most primitive member of a genus which includes two
            other birds, also known as <strong>babbling jays</strong>, on account of their general habits and wide
            repertoire of calls. <strong>It is a very young species, having been in existence for no more than 4,000
                years</strong>. Slightly older are its two similar-looking close relatives, the larger
            <strong>Black-breasted babbling jay</strong> and the smaller <strong>white-winged babbling jay</strong>
            which live further north along the edges of tropical jungles where forests meet open plains. All three
            babbling jays are social and form monogamous pair bonds retained year to year. Males and females hold
            territories together throughout the breeding season and are identical in size and appearance. </p>
        <p><strong>All species also utilize an exceptionally wide array of vocalizations to communicate different things
                with each other and their offspring, such as food sources and different varieties of predators.</strong>
            <strong>They care for their young for a very long period</strong> for birds their size, up to a full year,
            during which time the parents don't usually breed again, <strong>and their chicks learn much from their
                parents, not only how to find food and avoid predators but also how to talk; understandings of different
                calls and how to produce them is not innate, but by the time they fledge, they will have picked up their
                parents' complex vocabulary and will in turn teach them to their own young.</strong></p>
        <p>The fork-tailed babbling jay shares all of the above attributes with its two close relatives, <strong>but
                lives in the harshest environment of all of them</strong>. It inhabits only a small belt of dry scrub
            and grassland south of the equator, known as the <strong>rainshadow desert</strong>, for it sits in the rain
            shadow of a large mountain range to the west that has prevented this particular region from becoming wetter
            and forested as the surrounding region has in the last twelve million years. Its ancestors moved here from
            the dry interior desert to the south, which has since receded in place of forest and is no longer adjacent
            to the dry habitat in which they now live.</p>
        <p><strong>Life in the rainshadow desert is harsh - food and water are comparably scarce and often hard to find
                for up to nine months a year, and the life-giving rains blow in only for a few fleeting weeks.
            </strong>As a result, the population of babbling jays which live here have developed a very complex social
            system in order to most successfully rear their offspring <strong>which is very similar to that which forms
                the foundation of wolf packs.</strong> In both the black-breasted babbling jay and white-winged babbling
            jay of milder climates, grown offspring often stay around to assist in rearing younger siblings. It was
            almost impossible, however, for a single pair of the jay population which gave rise to the fork-tailed
            babbling jays to raise young on their own in the dry, sparse climate in which they found themselves,
            <strong>making additional help obligatory.</strong> Food here, most of the time, is simply too widely spaced
            out and difficult to access. <strong>A pair of fork-tailed babbling jay can therefore reproduce only if
                assisted by at least two additional birds.</strong> This is most often accomplished when a new social
            unit is formed by either three siblings, the most dominant of which takes an unrelated mate, or by two
            siblings who each pair with a mate, <strong>but where the lower-ranking pair doesn't breed in exchange for
                the safety provided by having a flock to watch out for them. </strong>The social order between siblings
            that will as adults determine which pair is allowed to breed is determined at a young age through playful
            contests of strength, and aggressive conflict is very rare. As soon as the rains bring life to the dry lands
            in which they live, the dominant pair will commence to nest and hatch their offspring, which are incubated
            largely by the mother who is brought food in the form of insects and small animals by all three of the other
            partners. </p>
        <p><strong>When the young hatch all four forage to provide for the first brood of nestlings and then continue to
                feed them when they leave the nest. </strong>To find food, babbling jays are versatile foragers. They
            are mostly carnivorous, though will eat some seeds and fruit if it can be located. Their harsh, seasonally
            changing environment has required the development of especially good problem-solving skills versus their
            relatives in more stable environments and they have become extremely <strong>adaptable tool-makers and
                users.</strong> They find insects hidden in wood by stripping off the bark of trees and<strong>
                utilizing thorns or sharpened twigs to probe the holes made by wood-boring beetle larva in order to fish
                them out.</strong> Adults teach their young how to <strong>break the eggs of ground-dwelling birds by
                cooperatively hammering them with rocks</strong> which would be too large to handle singly, <strong>as
                well as how to kill dangerous stinging insects with weapons from a distance</strong> - using sharpened
            sticks or crushing them under stones, to render them safe for consumption. Far into the rainshadow desert
            there is little larger prey available, but toward the desert's borders where grassy plains and patchy
            thickets of trees are able to grow, herbivores such as molodonts and predators such as bludgebirds eke out a
            living. Here, the babbling jays learned to <strong>kill small herbivores with sharpened spears</strong>
            which are sometimes tipped with venom squeezed from the stingers of insects to provide a faster
            kill,<strong> and utilize sharp stone chips as axes or knives</strong>. Initially selecting the sharpest
            naturally-occurring stone chips they could find, some then learned to chip stones themselves, including
            flint, to produce the sharpest edges possible for butchering prey. They do this by holding other, harder
            stones in one foot, and hammering them against already thin flint chips to produce small, sharp cutting
            implements one to two inches long that can easily be carried around with them. </p>
        <p><strong>The process caught on culturally, and now most babbling jays know how to knap flint to create cutting
                tools,</strong> which they hold in their beaks and cherish as prized possessions. They also prey on
            other birds and desert-dwelling tribbetheres by chasing them into an ambush, or by imitating the distress
            calls of their offspring and then killing them as they come near to find the source of the sound.
            <strong>Where possible, they also routinely harass other animals to pirate their food</strong>, mimicking
            the alarm calls of other birds and shrieking them when they see one has something they want, so that the
            other bird takes panic and drops its prize or aggressively harassing larger predators while other group
            members quickly gather as much of the carcass as they can bring back to the group. <strong>They preserve all
                types of food by drying them </strong>- easy in the desert sun. Insects and whole small animals are
            skewered on thorns, while larger kills are butchered and the meat dehydrated in thin strips. Such larders,
            stocked in the rainy season, are then relied upon throughout leaner times. The jays teach their young all of
            their skills, both hunting and in food preservation - none of them are innate, and thus different
            populations utilize different methods of feeding. Some are skilled spearers but have no knives, others have
            specialized mostly to catch insects, and a few are truly generalist, able to make a tool suited to obtaining
            nearly any potential food source. The young begin mostly clueless as to how to make or use tools but become
            competent very quickly. <strong>The parents demonstrate to their young how to craft and utilize different
                tools, and the chicks mimic the adults actions and try to fish out insects or break open eggs from a
                very young age.</strong> Though their coordination is initially poor, they begin to develop these skills
            competently by four months of age. <strong>By six months, fledgelings begin proficiently hunting, and they
                are effectively mature - able to do everything their elders can - in only a year.</strong></p>
        <p>Purely going by its physical appearance, there would be no way you could determine that the little and
            seemingly plain fork-tailed babbling jay is such a big thinker. Its brain to body ratio is not dramatically
            larger relative to its body size than that of the other babbling jays or many other sparrowgulls (though
            it's notable that it is higher than any other living Earth bird, with a raven-sized brain in a jay's body),
            <strong>but it is especially efficient, making the absolute most of the available space</strong> while not
            making the brain so large that flying ability is hampered - <strong>a further continuation of the trend
                observed in ancestral passerine birds, which being constrained by the need to be light enough to fly
                differ from ground-based mammals in normally developing increasingly efficient, rather than simply
                larger, brains.</strong> In the fork-tailed babbling jay, this process of streamlining over hundreds of
            millions of years has allowed it a <strong>similar mental capacity to ourselves</strong>, with a brain
            weighing only 14 grams - <strong>literally one percent the weight of the human brain</strong>, which weighs
            about three pounds, or 1,400 grams. However, it must also be noted that the body of human being is also
            hundreds of times larger than that of a babbling jay.</p>
        <p>The fork-tailed babbling jay is not only highly intelligent in regards to problem solving and crafting tools
            to find food, <strong>but it is also demonstrably self-aware.</strong> The babbling jays have not only a
            wide repertoire of distinct calls used to communicate resources and threats, <strong>but have developed a
                proper complex language in order to most effectively communicate complicated ideas between individuals
                quickly. </strong>The instruction of this begins when the young are just hours old. In the nest,
            <strong>every newborn chick is given a distinct name</strong> in the form of a distinct sequence of
            syllables which is not used except when providing food to the particular chick to whom it has been given, so
            that by the time it leaves the nest it recognizes this name and responds excitedly when it is called upon in
            anticipation of food. <strong>It will keep this name throughout life.</strong> All of the chicks also learn
            the names of their parents and helpers, as each one repeats its own name before that of the chick it is
            feeding so that the chicks, once fledged, can immediately be expected to be able to distinguish between its
            caretakers. All of this knowledge is taken in by the chick even before it can see, let alone communicate
            back, and by the time the young is three weeks old it can easily distinguish each adult by its voice, put
            the right name to each face, and most importantly respond when called.</p>
        <h2>Growing Up and Learning the Language</h2>
        <figure><img alt="fledgeling babbling jay" src="images/8lNDnJ9.png" />
            <figcaption><strong>above:</strong> a seven week old fledgeling fork-tailed babbling jay, looking very
                scruffy and gangly compared to its sleek elders. Though it can fly by this age and its plumage will be
                filled in within another week, it will not fully develop its motor skills for several months and won't
                develop the brighter markings of its parents until one year of age.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p><strong>Only one brood is reared in a breeding group's first year, for the young require a very long period
                of teaching before they can ever be trusted to fend for themselves.</strong> They are encouraged to
            begin leaving the nest as soon as possible, before they can fly, so that their instruction can begin as soon
            as possible. <strong>The adults are firm with their young. They stop feeding them at the nest as soon as the
                chicks are physically capable of leaving it, instead luring them from a distance with mouthfuls of prey
                and beckoning them plaintively by calling their names</strong> so that eventually hunger outweighs
            apprehension and the chicks climb into the branches for their morsels. <strong>It is at that moment that at
                least a year of intensive education begins for the youngster.</strong></p>
        <p>One of the first changes in teaching which occurs once the young leave their nest is that the adults stop
            saying their own names to the young, so that the chicks firmly learn that their own names are distinct from
            those of their parents and do not need to follow them; <strong>the process of adjustment takes several days
                before the chicks thoroughly grasp the idea that their names are a static, unchanging concept which can
                be combined with other words and phrases to form sentences,</strong> but they soon understand it well
            enough, and at this age they also begin to mimic the vocalizations of the adults so that they can call and
            refer to individual adults. The very earliest sentence they learned in the nest was "adult's name, your
            name", which at the time meant nothing more to them than food was being delivered and by whom. At this time
            the name becomes a more abstract concept and not simply a dinner bell. The second word usually added to the
            name is a command, a whistling note that means "come to me." At first it is uttered only in conjunction with
            a chicks' name and in anticipation of a meal, but within a few days the chick will also respond to this
            command alone and without an immediate bribe at hand. <strong>The adults can then reliably lead the chick to
                safer or more secure roosts, out of sight of potential predators, or anywhere else that it would be in
                their best interest to go. </strong>Being small prey animals, the babbling jays are highly vulnerable to
            predators and must learn very quickly how to avoid each type of them, as there is very little room for
            error. <strong>Different enunciation of the same call can be used to tell the chicks to move more quickly -
                to escape a ground-based predator that is approaching or slowly - if it needs to quietly slip into cover
                to avoid being spotted by a bird of prey.</strong> The "come" call soon expands to include other living
            beings than just the chicks, such as predators, <strong>and the tone can then be used not only to tell the
                chicks how to avoid the threat but also the speed and manner in which the threat itself is
                coming.</strong> Because the chicks are flightless for at least two weeks after leaving the nest, it is
            of priority they be taught to avoid predators even before they learn the words for food. </p>
        <p><strong>Fork-tailed babbling jays have a vocabulary of thousands of distinct words, and speak a complex
                language of bird song, the individual components of which are spoken too quickly to be understood by the
                human ear. Their languages originate from varied repertoires of predator alarm calls, like those used by
                prairie dogs, and still feature a distinct term for every predator their young will ever come
                across</strong> - not so much every species, but every "type". "Birds of prey that come from above" are
            one type, and are described as their own chirp which is further described by descriptive vocalizations that
            tell its location, size, speed of approach and whether or not it has taken notice of them. Other names for
            danger generally translate to similarly descriptive titles, such as "birds of prey that sneak through the
            trees", "climbers from the ground", such as a molodont or a bumblebadger, and "running land animal", such as
            a circuagodont. Different populations utilize different words and some are very specific in their names for
            each animal in the environment, equivalent to referring to different words for a hawk and an owl, which
            though similar hunt differently, whereas others rely on very general words that would broadly be equivalent
            to "cat", "raptor", or "snake." No matter what exact words the young are taught, however, they quickly learn
            to identify and respond accordingly to different threats. <strong>By five weeks of age, when the chicks
                first begin to flutter from one tree to another, they are competent in understanding phrases consisting
                of what the threat is, how it's behaving and how quickly it's moving, and how to avoid it</strong>
            (should you climb, or should you stand still, or should you fly away?) <strong>By this time, they also begin
                to ask questions to actively engage in the learning process</strong>. There are no specific phrases used
            to specify that a sentence is a question, rather, rather than a statement, but rather the difference is
            determined by the enunciation of the syllables in the word. Questions asked by the young at this stage are
            thus such things as "predator?", in reference to an unknown animal, and if the response is no, asking "what
            is?", to which the adults will then describe the creature. If it's not harmful, it might be a big one that
            can help them to find food by disturbing insects hidden in the grass while it walks, or it could be another
            bird that won't harm them but competes for food, and so is an enemy and to be chased out of the territory.
            In addition to teaching their own specific vocabulary describing the many types of threats that go bump in
            the night and will eat any unwary baby babblers, <strong>the adults also intermittently spout off the
                mimicked alarm calls of other birds and animals in the area in conjunction with their own words</strong>
            to teach the young to also pay attention to what the animals around them are saying, as they too can serve
            to warn them of danger as well and may notice something that the chicks have not.</p>
        <p>Once the young are decently educated on what predators are and how to avoid them and at least partially
            multilingual in that they understand the alarm notes of many other animals in addition to their own species,
            <strong>they begin learning less immediately necessary words for other objects, such as trees and water and
                animals, including those they eat.</strong> They begin to follow the adults as they search for food, and
            <strong>around six to seven weeks of age have entered the toddler stage, where they vigorously question the
                names of, and information about, everything they come across in the environment.</strong> All of the
            adults in the family unit impart their knowledge into the young, playing off of personal experience and to a
            lesser extent knowledge handed down to them from their own elders. Finding food in the dry scrubland is
            difficult and requires intelligence; the adults do most of their foraging on the ground, where they poke
            underneath tussocks of grass with their long beaks or overturn sticks and rocks in search of beetles,
            crickets, or insect larvae. <strong>The demonstrate to their young how to craft and utilize tools, and the
                chicks mimic the adults actions and try to fish out insects or break open eggs from a very young age but
                their coordination is initially poor. </strong>They begin to develop these skills competently by four
            months of age. <strong>Like human children, they are reprimanded for poor behavior, such as fighting or
                straying away from supervision, while being rewarded for following rules.</strong> However, the young
            also have some leeway in manipulating their parents - in particular, if they are hungry but don't want to
            find their own food, they may put themselves into potentially dangerous situations - such as leaving the
            safety of cover and exposing themselves in the open - and thus attract all of the flocks' attention in order
            to bribe their parents into offering up a tasty meal to lure them back to safety, when such offerings would
            otherwise be discontinued in expectation of the young foraging for themselves. The plan can work well, but
            it can also backfire if the young is snatched by a predator during its defiant attempt to milk its parents
            for special treatment, <strong>and so the behavior tends to be self-limiting; surviving siblings will not
                quickly try it if they see one of their own taken in this manner.</strong> It is usually safer to work
            for your own food than risk being eaten in order to get a free meal from the adults. <br /><strong><br />As
                fork-tailed babble jay chicks become older, they also become more proficient flyers and can travel far
                across their territory in search of food with their parents</strong>. During the wet season they
            returned at night to the communal nest - a complicated domed structure of mud, grass, and twigs which
            provided protection from the elements, but they become nomadic as the dry season returns, roosting wherever
            they happen to be on a given night and not normally crafting any sort of shelter.</p>
        <p>Juvenile fork-tailed babbling jays are very playful creatures, which hone adult skills through mock-fights
            among their siblings and playful games that allow practice of their climbing, flying, hunting and predator
            avoidance abilities. <strong>They make up their own games of hide and seek, keep-away, and king of the
                roost, and also adapt feathers, sticks, stones and clumps of grass into toys used in imaginative play.
            </strong>A tuft of grass tied together with two long feathers out the sides for wings becomes a mock
            cricket, which is tossed between the kids and pounced upon in the absence of a real one. A<strong>s the
                chicks become more mature and if resources are sufficiently abundant, their parents may kidnap the
                fledgelings of other, smaller birds and provide them to their young as pets</strong>. If the chicks feed
            them and can successfully rear them to independence, it is especially good practice for when they themselves
            are expected to take up a parental role in the family unit - and if they fail, the chicks can be eaten like
            any other prey. Just as humans find baby animals with large eyes and small features like their own babies
            appealing, and often transfer maternal instincts onto them, <strong>babbling jays - even very young ones -
                are smitten with fledgelings, especially those with wide yellow gape flanges like their own
                nestlings</strong> and are instinctively compelled to feed them and nurture them. <strong>So strong are
                these instincts that babbling jays will adopt orphans of both their own and related species almost as a
                matter of course, and if they are unsuccessful in raising young of their own may even orchestrate a
                kidnapping of a neighboring group's chick.</strong> Though many other birds are easily raised on the
            same diet as their own young, and other species of babbling jays are even able to learn and understand some
            words, they are unable to truly learn the language which is so vital for communication between members of
            the group and therefore occupy a niche in the group between child and pet. <strong>As soon as they are
                grown, adults often grow tired of these incompetent fellows which cannot contribute as expected to the
                group and drive them off.</strong></p>
        <p>The attitude exhibited by the fork-tailed babbling jay towards hunting other birds varies. Generally there is
            no taboo against eating eggs or the precocial chicks of ground-dwelling fowl, but because they are so
            instinctively inclined to nurture babies, <strong>there is a nearly universal revulsion to the killing of
                altricial nest-bound chicks and fledgelings</strong> and so this is done only as a last resort if other
            food is not available. There is no similar cultural aversion to hunting other birds once they are adults and
            have lost their endearing gape markings and awkward uncoordinated motor patterns, however.</p>
        <p>By the beginning of their second year, young babbling jays considered adults. They are capable of finding
            various types of food on their own, without adult assistance, and have learned to make their own tools when
            necessary. They have mastered their family's language, the names of all local predators, and the ways to
            deal with each one. They are not yet sexually mature, but <strong>are physically and mentally fully
                developed.</strong> However, they will continue to expand their vocabularies throughout life. Unlike
            most birds, they retain the ability to learn entirely new languages easily throughout adulthood. <strong>The
                behavior patterns utilized in learning to speak are identical to those of other songbirds as they are
                learning to sing</strong>, and so technically <strong>the entirety of babble-jay language is an
                extremely specialized song</strong>, which is modified and expanded throughout life rather than only in
            childhood as in other birds. This ability to readily learn not only new components of their native tongue
            but also other languages with completely different rules late into life is important for the babble jay as
            it matures, because <strong>between one and three years of age, depending on the size of their original
                family, offspring begin to disperse, often integrating into other family groups which may speak entirely
                differently</strong>.</p>
        <h2>Leaving the Nest</h2>
        <p><strong>When and whether young leave their family group is highly dependent on a number of variables,
                particularly their birth order.</strong> Very few chicks disperse in their parents' first reproductive
            year. <strong>Instead, they become helpers along with their aunts and uncles, immediately assisting in
                rearing the next clutch.</strong> In their second season together, the dominant pair breeds again.
            <strong>Now with plenty of help to go around, they only feed their offspring for as long as they are bound
                to the nest - only for three weeks - and then pass on the labor to their helpers</strong>. Chicks
            develop physically at a very rapid speed, but even so after such a short period the chick is still
            flightless and only one quarter of its adult size. Nonetheless, it can walk, climb, and perch, and it is
            ejected from the nest,<strong> at which point it is totally under the care of its siblings and relatives
                while its parents lay a third clutch of eggs, and so forth, rearing up to four broods per year for as
                long as conditions remain good, until the dry season returns.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>When the fledgelings are ejected from the nest, they are immediately adopted by these helpers, who
                will now number from as few as three to as many as twenty.</strong> The job of raising and teaching the
            young in all generations but the first is now entirely relegated to the aunts, uncles, and older siblings,
            while the parents produce multiple consecutive clutches while conditions are good enough to allow it and
            feed them only until they can walk, then pass them on to the helpers. The more adults available to feed,
            teach, and protect the young in the second season mean that more offspring survive, so that by the third
            season and especially the fourth the flock has usually become very large. <strong>At this time, it may
                contain too many members to be efficient, and some must leave either to band with other families or, if
                they are bold enough, to begin their own.<br /></strong><br /><strong>Females of two or three years old,
                who are becoming sexually mature, usually leave the group first</strong>, but males will also disperse
            less frequently. Single males or females attempt to join a neighboring band, and <strong>to be accepted they
                must spend several weeks to months tagging alone on the outside as they attentively listen to and learn
                their distinct dialect</strong>, which may be distinct from that which they were raised with. As long as
            they become fluent speakers able to follow rules and direction, <strong>they are usually welcomed into the
                group as an extra helping hand to raise the young.</strong> Once there, they will usually form a pair
            bond with a similarly aged partner of usually - but not invariably - the opposite sex. <strong>These pairs
                still don't initially breed, but may themselves leave the second group together and do so the following
                year, or else if they can reach a high social standing, they may be able to replace the dominant
                breeding pair if one or the other passes away or falls ill. </strong>The same situation can also
            eventually allow the helpers in the original family to take a place as the dominant breeding pair, but
            <strong>the strict hierarchical nature of babbling jay society still means that the majority of individuals
                do not reproduce and instead help continue their genetic lines indirectly, by raising their siblings and
                parents' offspring.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Young which are reared in old, stable families which have been established for generations often have
                to leave their groups quickly, shortly after their first birthdays,</strong> as their families'
            territories may not be rich enough to support a high concentration of birds. <strong>Still young and
                inexperienced, pairs or trios of these young siblings often go off on their own together and mingle with
                other sibling groups from other families doing the same and it is in this way most entirely new families
                are formed. </strong>Most often members of two or three families join together to form a new social
            group, with each individual pair-bonding to an unrelated individual. Siblings usually have respected and
            established places in the social hierarchy but when unrelated birds come together they will often spend
            several days displaying and mock-fighting in order to determine who is the fittest, as only one pair in this
            group, like those they were raised in, will usually be allowed to reproduce. <strong>The need for social
                companionship and the protection of a flock outweigh the instinct to breed</strong>, and those birds who
            are less dominant usually accept a position as a helper for the dominant pair's offspring, <strong>but may
                on occasion decide to go it alone for a time and search out another group in which it may stand a better
                chance of breeding. </strong></p>
        <h2>Exceptions to the Rule</h2>
        <p>Fork-tailed babbling jay society is centered on the hierarchical breeding system, but the high intelligence
            of the modern babbling jay can, in some environments, mean that obtaining food is no longer as difficult as
            it once was, and <strong>the strict system is no longer an efficient breeding strategy.</strong> Babbling
            jay cultures which still rely mostly on insects and other small-widely-spaced prey deep in the desert, like
            their ancestors, find the system effective, but those which are proficient at many different types of
            hunting, and particularly those that are good at scavenging from larger predators, <strong>will break
                convention. </strong></p>
        <p>Babbling jays living in situations where food is more abundant, along the desert's borders, <strong>sometimes
                adopt an altered hierarchical breeding system in which more than one pair are permitted to lay
                eggs</strong>. Normally subordinate females who attempt to rear eggs will be evicted from the clan by
            the dominant pair and thus will not attempt to do so unless they are certain that they have a following of
            siblings which will go with them to help, because a single individual will not likely survive let alone
            raise chicks on its own, but if food is very abundant <strong>superfamilies</strong> of up to fifty birds
            containing as many as ten breeding pairs may form. <strong>In this instance, however, only the dominant pair
                is still permitted to lay multiple clutches, with the subordinate ones having to stop breeding after
                their first clutch fledges in order to help raise not only their own fledgelings but those of the
                dominant pair, along with the rest of the group.</strong></p>
        <h3>Fire</h3>
        <p><strong>Some, but not
                all, babbling jays understand the use of fire to cook food.</strong> As small predatory birds, they are
            naturally inclined to search out smoke in the sky and follow it to the edges of wildfires in order to
            capture the small insects and animals that flee from the flames, and scavenge the casualties when the fire
            has burned out. In grassier areas where fires are common, babbling jays become accustomed to them and learn
            to <strong>seek them out to find food.</strong> Recognizing that meat scavenged in the aftermath of fire
            often develops an appealing taste and ease of digestion, <strong>some jays opportunistically cook food by
                bringing it to residual patches of hot coals remaining after a fire has burned out to roast them, which
                can also serve to dry them out quickly and aid in their preservation. </strong>When the coals cool and
            the fire has fully died out, however, babbling jays have not yet learned ways to produce it on their own,
            nor are they dependent on it to survive. Because they cannot manufacture fire on their own, <strong>they
                have also not learned to utilize it as a weapon.</strong></p>
        <h3>Recreation</h3>
        <p>Babbling jays are also creative in ways that don't necessarily relate to ensuring their immediate survival.
            Though their harsh environment often means that adults have little time to play, during times of plenty when
            hunting and teaching don't have to take up all of their time, they often play games similar to those played
            by the young. They may also play games which are variations on catch, using bundles of grass or twigs.
            <strong>They even produce art</strong>; they paint strips of bark and stones with natural pigments, often
            applying blood to a feather as a brush or working with a piece of charcoal or chalk. <strong>The jays create
                abstract works as well as detailed drawings of themselves and other animals in their
                environments.</strong> Cutting tools used to butcher animals are also sometimes used for artistic
            carving, to create artwork on the trunks of trees or to carve figures from pieces of wood.</p>
        <p><strong>Singing is a common past time</strong>, and serves to affirm social bonds. Like human singing, it is
            typically a melodic variation on normal speech, with exaggerated sounds and enunciation. Because babbling
            jays have a syrinx, like other birds, <strong>they can produce multiple sounds at once</strong> and so a
            single individual can produce both a spoken song and a purely melodic beat behind it, <strong>effectively
                becoming a true one-man band.</strong></p>
        <h3>Religion and Superstition</h3>
        <p><strong>Fork-tailed babbling jays are highly intelligent birds</strong> which quickly make connections as to
            what works best to solve a problem. <strong>They are analytical and reluctant to believe anything that they
                do not directly observe, which means that they are neither religious nor spiritual. </strong>However,
            <strong>they can still be superstitious creatures.</strong> Not understanding the complex mechanics behind
            weather or the day and night cycles, among other things, <strong>they often believe in false correlations
                equaling causation, such as flowers and certain animals being born from rainstorms if they appear
                suddenly after a hard rain.</strong> These occurrences are both common in their dry, seasonal habitat
            where flowers lie dormant as seeds through drought and creatures such as triops and the young of changeling
            birds readily appear in short-lived ponds during the wet season, and <strong>have given rise to a creation
                myth that is followed in some form or another by most babbling jays.</strong> The story states that
            <strong>the world was once all desert, with nothing but sand and rock, and that all plants and animals were
                born one day in an especially intense rainstorm.</strong> Though no jay alive now was alive at the time
            when this was said to have occurred, <strong>the story is similar enough to a real, observed process that
                many accept it as fact.</strong> They mostly lack deities in the strict sense, with the possible
            exception of one, known as the <strong>Sky Sea</strong>. It refers to the blue-green planet which Serina
            orbits, usually visible in the sky, <strong>believed by some to be a distant pool of water in the heavens
                and the source of both seasonal rainfall and the large flood believed to have produced all
                life.</strong> </p>
        <p>The origin of the story likely is unknown, but many babbling jays are now convinced that the planet is in
            some way responsible for rains, and that it is some sort of sentient being. This belief is likely another
            superstition originating from some chance freak rainstorm following an especially long drought coinciding
            with some sort of attempt to ask the planet to share some of its water. Though it rarely responds,
            <strong>any situation in which the rains return coincides with a notable request for water strengthens their
                beliefs.</strong> Belief in the sky sea is not universal, but <strong>is the most likely starting point
                for the formation of a real religion if they will ever have one, and these confirmation biases developed
                when coincidentally the rains do arrive after the birds try asking for them may be the precursor to
                blind faith.</strong> It is important to note, however, that <strong>the single possible deity known to
                the babbling jay is still a physical object, albeit an unattainably distant one, and therefore still
                falls into the category of things the jays are able to observe.</strong> There are no invisible gods or
            spirits in the babbling jay's lives watching over them or controlling their world and <strong>the babbling
                jay may simply be less inclined to need to invent such a level of control over their world in order to
                be content than human beings, or they could be too young of a race to have developed the concept yet.
            </strong> The general philosophy of the babbling jay is of living in the moment, finding food today and not
            thinking about far in the future or past. They seem to feel that life is inherently chaotic and without
            purpose except to survive and help your loved ones survive, and they don't seem to require anything more
            than that to feel fulfilled. </p>
        <p><strong>Babbling jays are not really spiritual at all. </strong>They understand the permanence of death and
            <strong>do not believe in an afterlife. </strong>They bury their dead and understand that bodies break down
            and decompose after death. To suggest that anything of the jays' personality could survive the process as a
            spirit would likely be viewed as nonsensical, as to the jays there is no personality without the living bird
            to possess it. The body is not a shell, housing some mysterious life force, but all that there is.
            <strong>As predators, they are aware how easily life can be taken and are not generally afraid of the idea
                of their own mortality.</strong> While they are naturally driven to survive as long as possible, death
            is acknowledged as the ultimate and inescapable end to the journey for all animals, including themselves.
            This doesn't mean that the deaths of friends or family don't affect them, as they certainly do -
            <strong>babbling jays often visit grave sites of loved ones, and keep feathers from departed family members
                as keepsakes, preening them and keeping them in good condition as a memorial long after their owners
                have gone.</strong></p>
        <h3>A Final Word on Family</h3>
        <p>Intrinsically social by nature, <strong>family is the most important thing to the babbling jay</strong>, and
            <strong>life without one is one of the most universal fears.</strong> There are no hermit babbling jays by
            choice, and there are only a handful of actions worthy of being exiled from the family.
            <strong>Intentionally harming either the breeding pair or the young maliciously, and not to reprimand them,
                is considered the worst offense. The attempted incubation of eggs by subordinate individuals without
                given permission by the dominant pair is another, in regions where resources don't allow it;
            </strong>however, mating or laying eggs - a natural process that can occur with or without mating largely
            irrelevant to the mother's intents - <strong>are both socially acceptable, so long as no intent is made to
                hatch the eggs</strong> (most often, eggs not permitted to be reared due to resource scarcity are eaten
            by both the parents and the group when newly laid.) Murder of a group member is very rarely tolerated by the
            rest <strong>but can rarely occur in violent mutinies by multiple lower-ranking birds intent on
                breeding.</strong> Different groups of babbling jays are intolerant of each other during the breeding
            season when hormonal aggression is high but prefer avoidance to aggressive conflict, <strong>while when the
                young are older the attitude is largely one of tolerance</strong>, because groups must regularly
            exchange members - mostly females - to prevent inbreeding, and the actions of a group that is particularly
            xenophobic and forbids the admission of new blood would eventually result in the accumulation of harmful
            mutations within that group <strong>that would likely lead to its eventual extinction.</strong></p>
        <p>Babbling jays have an average lifespan of ten to fifteen years and a maximum lifespan of about twenty five.
            <strong>Males live longer than females, perhaps because they do not use up their bodily reserves laying
                numerous eggs,</strong> and stay fertile until the age of ten or twelve. Females are only fertile up
            through the age of six or seven, and fertility peaks at age five. <strong>A dominant breeding pair usually
                retains his position in the hierarchy for five or six years, at which point they usually adopt a
                position as helpers for the rest of their lives while a pair comprising one of their high-ranking sons
                and an unrelated female which has joined the group takes over.</strong> The siblings of the first
            dominant pair never attain breeding status in the original group unless one of the main pair dies and the
            surviving partner is both unrelated and opposite sex, <strong>but they will often leave the group after two
                or three years, once it has enough other individuals to help rear young, and start their own breeding
                group with some of the dominant pair's youngest offspring as their own helpers.</strong> Considered
            socially adult at one year and able to breed at two years of age, <strong>babbling jays have rapid
                generational turnover.</strong> Like most birds, they age well and don't normally show signs of slowing
            down until shortly before they die, <strong>meaning even relatively elderly individuals remain productive
                contributors to raising the young. </strong>If an individual in the group does fall ill, however,
            <strong>it is normally treated very sympathetically and provided for in the manner of a juvenile until it
                either recovers or succumbs to whatever is ailing it. </strong></p>
