        <h1>Some Words On Intelligence</h1>
        <p>Since the evolution of life on Earth, <strong>there has been an observed tendency towards the evolution of
                animals with more complex brains</strong>. Neornithe birds - passerines and their sister clade the
            parrots in particular - <strong>have larger brains and can be inferred to be more intelligent than the very
                brightest non-avian dinosaurs before them</strong>, the Troodonts. <strong>Troodonts, however, were
                themselves bigger of brain than any theropods before them and and these in turn still had larger brains
                than the lizard-like reptiles they evolved from</strong>.<br /><strong><br />Certain modern Earth
                mammals are undoubtedly the most intelligent synapsids ever to live.</strong> Carnivores and several
            groups of ungulates are demonstrably clever, and among placentals extremely high intelligence has evolved
            independently in primates, elephants, and dolphins. Before the end of the Cretaceous, there were no known
            animals as intelligent as even a dog or a pig. Just sixty-six million years later, not only were there dogs
            and pigs, but animals whose intelligence approached sapience, and not from one group but several, from two
            widely unrelated clades, which peaked of course in the primates with the evolution of humans.</p>
        <p><strong>The fact that a great many animals have not become relative geniuses in the time span in which
                ourselves and our avian, cetacean, and elephantine kin have done is of course proof that this trend is
                far from universal. </strong>For many animals a larger brain is only a burden, requiring lots of energy
            to be maintained, and survival is possible with the same more primitive equipment that their ancestors
            evolved tens or even hundreds of millions of years ago. For other creatures, though, intelligence is the
            answer, and intelligence, it seems, breeds further intelligence. <strong>During the Cenozoic multiple animal
                lineages simultaneously began approaching perhaps the ultimate endpoint of intelligence -
                sapience.</strong> Only one reached it - ourselves - but the potential was there for others.</p>
        <p class="asterism">&#8258;</p>
        <p><strong>Serina is an interesting world on which to observe the progression of intelligence, for its colonists
                included one relatively advanced animal group - a passerine bird - and many fairly primitive ones -
                invertebrates and ray-finned fish.</strong> The differences observed over hundreds of millions of years
            between these groups have been very dramatic, with one group of fish - the <strong>tribbetheres </strong>-
            and one group of mollusc - the <strong>snarks </strong>- in particular having become very intelligent in
            comparison to their ancestors. <strong>But there has not been as dramatic a continuation of this trend among
                Serina's birds</strong>, and it can only be inferred that is is because passerine birds are, relatively
            speaking, already a highly intelligent group which perhaps have already reached the peak of efficiency in
            their smartest Earthly forms, where a brain of any larger size is not advantageous except in extraordinary
            circumstance (circumstances like those which led to humans.) <strong>Conversely, more than one group of
                birds upon Serina has lost intelligence, developing smaller and simpler brains than their
                ancestors,</strong> further proving that life does not automatically become more complicated and
            intelligent over time; though it certainly can, it will not if conditions do not require it. These notable
            exceptions - in particular those species which have lost their endothermy such as mucks and certain
            changelings - notwithstanding, though, <strong>it is demonstrably certain that overall intelligence of birds
                on Serina in the late Pangeacene is greater than that of birds on the whole on Earth in the
                Holocene</strong>. Though Serina has not become a world of many different sapient bird cultures,
            <strong>most birds which occur there in the Pangeacene are more intelligent than the ancestral
                canary.</strong> Early radiations of dim-witted herbivores occured in the vaccuum of Serina's empty
            ecosystems in the Hypostecene, but this was not the trend just a few million years later by the Tempuscene,
            when a more varied ecosystem of predators and threats weeded out the dullest bulbs. </p>
        <p>Though a canary started off pretty far from a crow, intellectually speaking, the underlying structure of its
            brain was the same and it carried within it the potential to become crow-like quite readily. Multiple
            lineages of intelligent corvid-like birds have existed on Serina since the late Hypostecene, including forms
            capable of rudimentary tool use and cultural behavioral transmission. <strong>While truly gifted brainiacs
                that rival keas and New Caledonian crows are still relatively rare</strong>, they can be found among
            groups as distant as the <strong>sparrowgulls, bumblets and ornimorphs</strong>. Indeed, <strong>a more
                general intellectual prowess comparable to certain smaller corvids such as jays and other parrots would
                now be considered typical for a wide variety of bird lineages</strong> including almost everything
            except previously noted examples of ectotherm birds, most softbill birds, some primitive bumblets, and true
            galliwalt-descended waterfowl, which are the most primitive of birds alive in the Pangeacene and have
            retained a relatively simple chicken-like brain. </p>
        <p>In very basic terms, extraordinarily <strong>few birds on Serina have ever evolved which are smarter than the
                smartest of Earth birds, but similarly intelligent birds have become more numerous</strong>. Indeed, in
            over two hundred million years only one bird is known to have ever clearly surpassed the most intelligent
            Earth birds intellectually, and it has done so only very recently. At the very end of the Pangeacene,
            approximately 240 million years after the very first birds were introduced, <strong>a new tier of bird sits
                at the threshold of something potentially groundbreaking.</p>
