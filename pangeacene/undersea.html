        <h1>The Life of the Undersea Savannah</h1>
        <figure><img alt="undersea savannah" src="images/dbhc5wd-00b32026-d840-487c-9470-f853e5f01b11.png" />
            <figcaption><strong>above:</strong> the undersea savannah </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>The <strong>undersea savannahs</strong> of Serina's shallow seas in the Pangeacene - immense tracts of
            underwater grassland founded by <strong>sea bamboo</strong>, are a hotspot for marine life. Exceptionally
            rich in nutrients, they support an incredible bounty of animal life, from the smallest <strong>planktant
            </strong>to the largest grazer. Shoals of colorful fish find food in the grass, sheltering under the bodies
            of large grazers for protection from their own predators. Herds of herbivorous <strong>burdles</strong>,
            gentle and easy-going, glide over the submerged plains like their ancestors once did in the air.<strong>
                Primitive sea birds</strong> mimicking <strong>gulls</strong> and <strong>ducks</strong> flock along the
            surface, feeding on abundant fish, invertebrates and plant foods and nesting on nearby land, laying
            hard-shelled eggs and raising chicks as they have done for millions of years. <strong>Even after 228 million
                years, in fact, these conservative, familiar forms persist, providing a stark contrast to the strange
                state which evolution has bestowed upon their distant kin</strong> from whom they split millions of
            generations ago.<strong> The ancestors of both burdles and Serinan sea gulls reached Serina as
                canaries</strong>. Technically, no matter how divergent they become in form and habit, <strong>both
                still are</strong>. Though fertile reproduction between their lines ceased almost at the start of
            Serina, <strong>they remain tied together - however bizzare the concept would seem - as kin,</strong>
            isolated here on this strange world more than two hundred million years ago.</p>
        <p>~~~</p>
        <p>One of the most unusual grazers of these aquatic grasslands is the eight-foot long
            <strong>manatweet</strong>, an herbivorous descendant of the <strong>water snuffle</strong> with<strong> a
                highly flexible upper lip which it uses to pull vegetation into its mouth</strong>. A diet of plant
            matter, rather than molluscs, has caused the sensitive feelers on the snout to shrink while the entire
            appendage became a small grasping trunk ideal for such a purpose. While some its kin - the mitten and the
            glove - returned to land, the manatweets have gone further down the path of aquatic adaptation and
            <strong>are now almost completely independent of the shore</strong>. Spending their lives floating leisurely
            in these warm shallows, propelled with powerful beats of large webbe feet, they must still come ashore to
            rocky offshore islets and protected coves to incubate their single large egg. To do so, they push themselves
            out of the water with the large hind feet and rise to rest on a cushion of fat on their rumps, incubating
            the egg on top of their feet and adjacent to a featherless patch of skin on their stomachs, much like some
            penguins once did on Earth. The chick which hatches is precocial and can swim and feed itself almost
            immediately, but remains with its parents for several months to protect it from predators. </p>
        <p><strong>Manatweets are on the way to losing their feathers</strong>, as do all totally marine birds, since
            birds cannot rely on them for insulation if they cannot leave the water for a time each year to molt them.
            They retain a short, shaggy pelage over their bodies and have been slow to lose it, as their leisurely
            lifestyle means the resulting drag is not a major problem for moving through the water, <strong>but it no
                longer serves any purpose</strong>, being too sparse an unkempt for insulation - instead, the body is
            insulated by fat. Chicks are initially insulated by down but only for the first few weeks of their lives,
            after which they have laid down enough fat to do the job. <strong>Manatweets are omnivorous in infancy and
                hark back to their ancestors</strong>, catching any small fishes or invertebrates they come across
            rooting in the grass and using this extra protein to fuel their rapid growth. <strong>Adults, however, are
                almost completely herbivorous</strong>, only consuming animal food accidentally while grazing. </p>
        <p>Another large marine bird shares this habitat with the manatweet, but its behavior and form are very
            different. This creature, though comparable in size, <strong>has four flippers, not two</strong>. Its
            feathers are even more reduced, limited to bristle-like whiskers on its snout and a short layer of vestigial
            fuzzy filaments, and <strong>its snout is long and its jaws full of needle-like teeth well-suited to
                catching slippery prey</strong>. It swims at a much more hasty pace with alternating pulses of its fore
            and hind flippers, chasing small fishes. It is a <strong>dolfinch</strong>, a fully-aquatic
            <strong>bumblet</strong> descended from a burrowing ancestor which began to hunt near water at the start of
            the Pangeacene. <strong>It is now completely aquatic</strong>. The ovoviviparous bumblets were already
            adapted to low oxygen environments underground, <strong>the walls of their oviducts being extremely
                vascularized so that they were able to flood their egg pouch with oxygen</strong> to maintain a state of
            gas exchange within it sufficient to keep the developing young in good shape, and this also allowed to them
            to make short dives underwater to feed without suffocating their young. To spend greater lengths of time
            underwater without breathing, however, required further adaptation. </p>
        <p><strong>The modern dolfinch has finally taken the vivas' reproductive system to its pinnacle, and become
                truly viviparous</strong>. The egg it produces is much smaller than would be expected, no larger than a
            golf ball, and its shell is extremely thin. <strong>After a few days in the oviduct, it fuses to the wall of
                blood vessels and the embryo's circulatory system connects directly to that of the mother.
            </strong>Dolfinches are thus the second bird lineage to develop proper pregnancy, alongside the flightless
            quadrupedal changelings. <strong>After hundreds of millions of years of evolution, the dolfinch is now
                completely freed of the constraints of an egg.</strong> Its young safely developing inside the mother's
            body, connected to a lifeline of her air supply, she is free to dive deep in search of food, surfacing only
            every fifteen to twenty minutes to flood her system with fresh oxygen. While its ancestors were born very
            underdeveloped as a result of the loss of calcium in the eggshell so that they were softer and less fragile
            in the egg pouch, and therefore needed a prolonged period of care in a nest, this is not the case for the
            dolfinch. Because the young is attached directly to the mother's body, it has a ready supply of all
            nutrients and minerals it needs, including calcium, so that its skeleton can be fully developed by birth.
            <strong>Dolfinch calves are thus born large, alert, and mobile from birth</strong>, able to swim alongside
            their mothers and learn to feed themselves within a few months (being brought food by their mothers in the
            meantime.) </p>
        <p>Dolfinches catch their food in toothy jaws, <strong>uniquely among birds of the Pangeacene since the
                extinction of all other vivas</strong>; like their kin, however, <strong>they still sport specialized
                keratinous teeth on their tongues and beaks</strong>. Some of their distant herbivorous relatives of
            bygone eras developed especially sophisticated chewing mechanisms with their tongues and bill teeth, but the
            ancestors of the dolfinch diverged and went down a carnivorous path very early on, before any of these
            adaptations had appeared. Instead, they use their teeth only to grasp prey and<strong> have developed teeth
                in the lower jaw as well as the upper to assure a firm grip.</strong> The tongue is not used in biting
            or chewing, but in some dolfinches <strong>the teeth present upon it have specialized instead into elongated
                baleen-like filaments used in filter feeding</strong> just like the pelecanaries of eons past. By
            pushing the tongue against the upper jaw, these filaments serve to sein microrganisms from mouthfuls of
            water.</p>
        <p>As aquatic as the dolfinch has become, however, <strong>it is still beat by another group which calls the
                undersea savannah home</strong>. Totally <strong>aquatic changelings</strong>, descended from species
            with aquatic larvae, have now settled in the sea. <strong>They are highly neotenic creatures</strong>,
            maturing in an effectively larval state and never developing into a flying or feathered adult form, but
            <strong>also extremely specialized in their own right.</strong> They have transformed the tadpole-like tails
            of their ancestors into fluked fins with a jointed, bony internal support, and they have
            <strong>re-developed gills from what was once the ear canal of their flying ancestors</strong>, a necessity
            once they reached a size larger than allowed them to breathe with their skin alone. Reproduction consists of
            nothing more than the release of eggs and sperm freely into the water. <strong>The result is an extremely
                impressive impersonation of a fish</strong>, though a few traits easily distinguish them from most of
            Serina's true fish stock; <strong>their fins are fleshy, without rays, and inside their flippers can still
                be found the remnant bones of a jointed wing.</strong> They have a neck, albeit a short one, which can
            be rotated to feed and look around. <strong>And they still retain a beak, the shape and form of which varies
                depending on their diet. </strong>They have taken the most extreme return to the sea of any land
            creature, and now fly through the sea in flocks as their ancestors once did the air. Most forms remain
            social, and with acute eyesight, they compensate for the loss of their hearing with exquisitely vibrant
            markings, making them among the most brilliant of all "fish" to be found on the savannah.</p>
