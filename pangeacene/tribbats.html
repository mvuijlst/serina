        <h1>Tribbats</h1>
        <p><strong>Tribbats</strong> are a clade of flying tribbetheres which share a common ancestor with the
            canitheres, which
            have become the first group of vertebrates on Serina to independently develop powered flight. This has
            occurred via five elongated bat-like wing fingers attached together by a flexible membrane of skin, very
            alike the wing of an Earth bat. Like other tribbetheres they are active, warm-blooded animals with a furry
            pelage. Smaller than canitheres, most tribbats are still largely predatory but feed more on insects than
            vertebrate prey, though they do prefer larger insects; none have specialized to feed significantly on the
            tiny flying types that cloud the skies. Rather, with their highly extensible jaws and good eyesight, the
            tribbats feed mostly on larger prey such as crickets and beetles, and sometimes small birds. They are
            notably more omnivorous than their ancestors and also partake significantly in the fruits and certain young
            leaves and buds of plants, with some species also favoring nectar.</p>
        <p>Tribbats vary from very clumsy fliers which use flight only to move between trees or escape predators to
            skilled aerial acrobats which are capable of high-speed maneuvers through dense forest in pursuit of prey or
            in flight of predators. The first tribbat was surely akin to the former group, and may have developed its
            flight initially as a combination of gliding and prey-grabbing behavior, resulting from the animal launching
            itself downwards in ambush from a high perch at a passing bird or insect below and grabbing it in the hands
            - inadvertently performing a flight stroke, which could have generated further lift and prolonged its
            descent until, over time, its grabby little fingers expanded into a webbed net attached to the body with
            patagia and it was capable of upward momentum. Primitive tribbats still exist today which feed in exactly
            this manner and are otherwise only highly labored flyers, which much prefer to climb through the trees. In
            these forms, the five wing fingers retain claws and a degree of grasping mobility. In more advanced groups,
            however, only the first two digits of the wing - which are not connected with patagia to the rest of the
            structure - retain their claws. In some groups, these fingers have become opposable, the "thumb" being able
            to rotate ninety degrees from the second digit, so as to still give it some ability to grasp food and to
            climb while the specialized wing digits are folded up out of the way when not in use. The hind limb has only
            two digits but they are also opposed in a manner that allows their owner to grab hold of a tree branch and
            to climb or to roost. In flight, the hind leg becomes a balancing tail, to which both wing membranes attach
            right along the "ankle".</p>

            <figcaption><strong>above:</strong> two clown tribbats - crow-sized frugivores of the equatorial rainforest
                - begin to
                stir at their roost tree in the evening hours. This species is crepuscular - most active at dusk and
                dawn - and they are preparing to spend the next few hours feeding. A third crawls over the ground
                nearby, perhaps to feed on fallen fruit. The color vision of these tribbetheres is excellent in order to
                locate ripe fruit and their communication, in addition to vocalizations in the form of chirps and
                squeaks, is highly based on body language that is elaborated upon with brightly colored, mobile ears and
                mouths which can be extended wide to reveal a blood red gape and make themselves appear larger in
                conflict. </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Tribbats are mostly animals of the tropical forest, as they are all adapted to roost in trees - usually
            hanging vertically by their tails in a posture reminiscent of fruit bats. A young group, they are still much
            less ecologically diverse than the flying birds but compete among many of them even in broad daylight -
            indeed, most tribbats are diurnal - for many of the same food resources. Their wing design is well suited
            for fast and agile flight and thus they occupy many small predator niches, chasing birds and larger insects
            on the wing in dense forests with unmatched maneuverability. In the open sky, however, birds still have them
            beat. Their wing design is inefficient for gliding flight and the open skies night and day swarm with
            changeling birds which never need land and spend their entire lives fluttering through the air in search of
            small flying insects. With solid bones and no air sacs, they are limited in size in much the same way as
            true bats to relatively small sizes. Many tribbats are still thus very much generalists, behaving much like
            flying lemurs or possums, climbing more than they fly, and still very tied to the forests from which they
            originate. </p>
        <p>Birds thus are still the lords of the air, and with the evolution of the quadrupedal changelings, some have
            now reached sizes unforeseen ever before in their history...</p>
