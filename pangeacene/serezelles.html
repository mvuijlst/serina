            <figcaption><strong>above:</strong> two species of serezelle; the <strong>warcrest</strong> (left} and the
                <strong>zebirb</strong>. The former is a browser, feeding on the sparse trees of the savannah, while the
                latter is a highly gregarious grazer. The zebirb is monomorphic, without external sex differences, but
                the male warcrest earns its name with a brightly colored, extendable crest of red and blue plumage that
                wraps around the back of its neck, which has been likened to the headdresses worn by the Native
                Americans.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p><strong>Serezelles</strong> are a group of cursorial, herbivorous placental birds native to the interior
            plains of the supercontinent, 228 million years post-establishment. Ranging considerably in size from shy,
            fox-sized thicket dwellers up to herd-dwellers as large as horses, most of the twenty or so living species
            are deer- or antelope-like in form and behavior. <strong>Serezelles are obligate quadrupeds</strong>, with
            their hind limbs positioned at the end of the body and their center of balance set forward, inhibiting
            prolonged bipedal locomotion. The wings are modified into lanky walking limbs, with the wrists being highly
            elongated. Descended from primitive knuckle-walkers, the serezelles still put weight on their knuckles, but
            the bones have subsequently joined back together, shortened substantially, and become bound in a rubbery pad
            of soft tissue, their claws projecting as sharp spurs from the inner wrist and used for defense. <strong>The
                hind feet are extremely elongated in a digitigrade posture</strong> with the ankle being set more than
            halfway up the limb. All weight is born on the very tips of the third and fourth digits, which are fused
            except at their tip and extraordinarily long. <strong>The hallux and second toe are raised high off the
                ground and are still well-developed despite serving little functional purpose</strong>, suggesting that
            the ancestors of the serezelle adapted their cursorial habits very quickly, without much time for the spare
            digits to be reduced. </p>
        <p>Serezelles are notably very often <strong>marked with bold, contrasting patterns of stripes and
                spots</strong>, which likely serve to hide their outlines when moving in large groups; because even some
            largely solitary species also sport them, however, it's plausible that the patterns evolved originally to
            break up the animals' form in the dappled light of sun and shade at the forests' edge, where the group first
            established itself, as in such Earth mammals as the okapi and the young of many deer. In addition to serving
            as a distracting maze of color to predators, <strong>the dark patches are also mask ultraviolet
                patterns</strong> visible to the birds themselves that may have significance in attracting mates and
            communicating over distances. The main predators of the serezelles, tribbetheres, <strong>cannot see in this
                spectrum</strong>, and <strong>thus these messages can be sent in a sort of secret code.</strong></p>
        <p>All serezelles are mostly herbivorous, and lacking the specialized feeding mechanics of such extinct
            herbivores as vivas, <strong>their method of feeding is primitive</strong> and involves cropping vegetation
            and grinding their food in a gizzard with the aid of gastroliths in the manner of primitive birds. Their
            stomachs are large and capable of rumination, well-suited to break down grass and twigs and other
            cellulose-rich foods, though seeds and fruit as well as large insects are taken opportunistically by many
            species.</p>
        <p>The young of serezelles are born large and extremely well-developed, able to walk within minutes of birth.
            Though their mother protects them for the first few months of their lives, <strong>she does not provide them
                with any sort of nourishment</strong>, either through regurgitation or with a crop milk secretion, as
            many earlier bird groups have done. Though the parent will lead her young to food sources as she fills her
            own stomach and shows her young indirectly what is and is not suitable to consume, the chick must feed
            itself.</p>
        <p>Serezelles are a young group, appearing within only the last thirty million years, but like many pioneer
            lineages - groups that arise rapidly in response to the ecological vacuum following a mass extinction - they
            are already beginning to decline in diversity in the face of new competitors as the rest of the biosphere
            recovers around them. Though their method of reproduction gives them an advantage over more primitive bird
            groups, and indeed was likely at least partially responsible for their own displacement of the earliest wave
            of flightless grazing waterfowl which proliferated at the start of the Pangeacene, <strong>now it seems that
                their primitive method of feeding is catching up with them in the face of yet another newly evolved
                plant</strong>, and <strong>a vigorous up and coming group of competitors.</strong></p>
