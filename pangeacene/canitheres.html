        <h1>Canitheres (dogbeasts)</h1>
        <p><strong>Canitheres</strong>, or <strong>dogbeasts</strong>, are a family of cursorial pursuit predator
            tribbetheres. <strong>They have been the most successful and prominent group of large predators on Serina
                through the early and middle Pangeacene</strong> and arose early after the Thermocene-Pangeacene
            boundary into recognizable forms in less than ten million years, now being found across the supercontinent
            from the southern interior desert to the tropical jungles and the temperate forests to the north. Canitheres
            have <strong>heterodont dentition</strong>, including<strong> fang teeth used to subdue prey and slicing
                cheek teeth to chew flesh before swallowing</strong>, a notable difference from earlier ancestors which
            swallowed all of their food whole. <strong>Their jaws are strong, able to grip large animals and pull them
                to the ground</strong>. The legs are highly elongated and digitigrade and weight is born on only four
            toes on the forelegs, with the innermost and sixth digit being reduced to dewclaws and the seventh finger
            either highly reduced or completely absent. <strong>Canitheres are cursorial and pursue their prey to
                exhaustion.</strong> Though most are terrestrial, <strong>one group of canitheres has become aquatic and
                seal-like, colonizing the seas.</strong></p>
        <figure><img alt="dogbeast and serezelle" src="images/chasingprey_by_sheather888-dbg7mqn.png" />
            <figcaption><strong>above:</strong> A dogbeast pursues a precocial young serezelle which it has separated
                from its herd. The predators' flexible spine, which moves in an up and down arc, works like a spring,
                collecting energy as it contracts its legs and releasing it as it extends, making for the most efficient
                running gait. The single hind limb gives the dogbeast an edge in maneuvering over its quadrupedal prey,
                allowing it to make tight corners and gain the upper hand in pursuit.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Canitheres are furry and warm-blooded, like all tribbetheres. Their brains are relatively large, though
            proportionally less so than most equivalent Earth carnivorans. Most species are fundamentally solitary but
            will tolerate each other in the presence of abundant food. Canitheres originally evolved to prey on small,
            quick-running terrestrial birds, especially the quadrupedal unguligrade changelings, but with the gradual
            displacement of these forms by more competitive <strong>molodonts</strong>, the canitheres <strong>have
                begun to feed as well upon their distant relatives</strong>, pushing some of them to develop their own
            convergent digitigrade forms just as well-adapted to flee the predators as the hunters are to catch them
            <strong>in yet another evolutionary arms race.</strong></p>
        <p>
            <div><strong>Canithere offspring are born in an underdeveloped and dependent state</strong>, reliant on
                their parents for many months before able to hunt on their own. Females or mated pairs usually dig out
                dens, though will take advantage of natural caves or hollows, in which to rear their young, which are
                fed with regurgitated remains of the adults' meals. The cubs are born blind and more or less deaf, but
                by four weeks of age are well-enough developed to begin leaving the nest for short periods. Though
                <strong>they do tend to resemble the puppies or cubs of Earth predators,</strong> with big ears, large
                expressive eyes, oversized paws and a general infant clumsiness, <strong>they are noticeably less
                    playful.</strong> While baby cats and dogs spend their days wrestling and chasing their littermates
                in games which hone skills they will need as adults to hunt, young canitheres seem to rely far more on
                innate instinctive abilities to hunt and are able to kill prey successfully even without practice in the
                form of play with others of their kind as soon as they are a few months old. Though they instinctively
                pursue small insects or animals from a very young age, <strong>they do not play to a great deal with one
                    another and most sibling-to-sibling interaction is aggressive and competitive. <br /></strong></div>
            <div>Though primarily solitary, <strong>some canitheres will cooperate to mob prey too large to tackle on
                    their own</strong>. This is a crude, uncoordinated effort, but the animals will usually share the
                spoils with minimal aggression.
