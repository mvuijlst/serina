        <h1>Archangels: Flying Giants</h1>
        <p>With the evolution of the quadrupedal changelings, flying birds have now managed reached sizes unforeseen
            ever before in their history. Able to use their wings, and not just their hind legs, to aid in launching off
            the ground, they can grow larger and heavier than strictly bipedal animals and many become gigantic. Their
            wrists elongate into a flight finger much like a pterosaurs', except instead of a membrane it still sports
            row after row of long veined feathers. Clawed digits on the wrist evolve into a crude padded hand upon which
            weight is born, while the wing digit - in fact a fusion of the second and third digit of the hand - folds
            upwards along the arms when on the ground. Once the form evolved, it diversified greatly.</p>
        <p>The first of the flying giants were generalist, crane-like animals not much larger than bustards, which would
            feed on virtually anything small and edible they came across. From them however arose the specialists; giant
            carnivores weighing hundreds of pounds, with wingspans rivaling small aircraft appeared, some specialist
            carrion consumers that keep watch for carcasses on the ground below, others stork-like predators that
            stalked small animals on the ground. Some predatory giants glided out into marine environments, literally
            over the heads of small primitive seabirds, and evolved to feed on larger fish prey which would be far
            beyond their means anyway; the smaller seabirds thus do not experience direct competition as a result. Two
            groups specialize to filter-feed; one group does so in flight, skimming the surface, the other as a wader.
            Both use tongues edged in rows of dense hair-like cillia to filter their food, like the pelecanaries of
            bygone times. </p>
        <p>Some of most unique of all the four-legged giants however went down a very different evolutionary path;
            rather than become more predatory, they become herbivorous, grazing like oversized geese and living in
            highly nomadic flocks which can soar on thermals and cross the supercontinent in a matter of weeks,
            following rain and converging where food is abundant and scattering as it becomes scarce. Known as
            <strong>archangels</strong>, they are most often colored mostly or entirely white, the color which most
            reflects harmful solar radiation at high soaring altitudes. Standing up to twenty feet tall, weighing up to
            four hundred and fifty pounds, and with wingspans that may reach more than forty feet, they are among the
            largest flying birds ever to live. Traveling thousands of miles over land, guided by their sense of smell in
            the constant pursuit of the stormy weather that produces the flushes of vegetation they require on the
            seasonal plains of the interior, they are true nomads that stay never too long in one place. They migrate in
            flocks that at times become thousands strong, traveling in V-shaped formations of twenty to thirty
            individuals which themselves group together in even larger groups that may extend for miles high in the
            atmosphere. When they find the rains, the flocks glide down to the ground, their immense wings spread out,
            and land awkwardly at a run on the ground, first with their feet and then catching themselves at the last
            minute with their wings, occasionally tripping and falling forwards. The excitement of the group is easy to
            see now as their trumpet-like calls fill the grassland and the birds gather in smaller groups, some birds
            keeping alert while the rest lower their heads to the ground to graze. They now gorge on the newly sprouting
            grasses and during this time rarely fly, folding their wings against their arms and preferring to gallop
            even if pressed by predators until the very last minute, when they will laboriously take flight from a run
            and vault themselves into the air like a hangglider. </p>
        <figure><img alt="archangels" src="images/giantbird_by_sheather888-dbe8u49.png" />
            <figcaption><strong>above:</strong>a flock of massive archangels come in for a landing, causing a herd of
                serezelles to scatter in their wake. With forty-five foot wingspans, the birds are as large as airplanes
                and must surely be an intimidating sight, though the zebirbs needn't fear; so long as they don't
                inadvertently tumble over them as they make their landings, the archangel is a harmless and a
                mild-mannered herbivore.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Their method of feeding is that shared by true waterfowl - they process their food rapidly, digesting what
            parts of it they can as quickly as possible and holding only a small amount of forage in their gut at any
            one time so as not to weigh themselves down excessively. They are thus inefficient feeders and have to feed
            for most of their waking hours for many days at a time in order to lay down sufficient fat reserves for
            several days of subsequent traveling when the rains move on and food in one location runs low. The life of
            an archangel is thus one of feasting and fasting. When the rains blow elsewhere and the grass dies back, the
            flock takes flight once more to follow, hopefully by that time having produced enough fat to keep them going
            until they reach greener pastures again.</p>
        <p>Archangels are so large that take-off and landing are both awkward affairs; indeed, with a full stomach, they
            may not be able to take flight without a headwind and thus when sufficient conditions do appear the entire
            flock will usually lift off at once. Because they are competent on the ground, this is not a major handicap
            unless there is a long spell of windless weather at the same time food begins to dwindle, in which case the
            largest and heaviest birds may starve. Once in the air, however, archangels are extraordinarily efficient
            flyers which can soar effortlessly on high thermals for many miles. To increase their surface area, they
            have developed hind wings on their legs which when spread behind them function as additional airfoils,
            helping them to stay airborne with as little effort as possible. </p>
        <p>To breed, all of the flying giants have abandoned their larval stages completely, like the ornkeys and
            serezelles, but to minimize the amount of weight they must carry have done so in a different way. Rather
            than retain their young inside their bodies, they have redeveloped a large shelled egg with sufficient food
            stores for it to develop before hatching. It differs from that of a more basal bird, however, in being
            soft-shelled and rubbery; its embryo is no longer reliant on the minerals of the eggshell for its
            development as in the ancestral bird. Most species lay clutches of such eggs in the soil and leave their
            development to chance and pay no attention to their young, which hatch fully capable of flight. As the vast
            majority of the giant flyers are highly nomadic and follow transient food sources either on the seasonal
            plains or out at sea, they cannot afford to settle down for long to incubate their eggs themselves. Chicks,
            though superprecocial at birth, are nonetheless so much smaller than their adults that they must occupy very
            different niches, and the juveniles of almost all groups start life as small insectivores living in or along
            the edges of forests, regardless of what they will eventually come to eat as adults. Even those of the
            archangels, which as adults will be herbivores, cannot subsist on such a diet in infancy, requiring a more
            protein-rich diet incorporating many insects for the first few years of life in order to reach their adult
            size. They therefore spend their first years in the forests and wetlands, leaving them to join with the
            nomadic flocks only when several years old. Maturity in most of the giants is fairly slow among birds, with
            adult size and sexual maturity not attained for six to ten years.</p>
