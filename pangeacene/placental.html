        <h1>The Evolution of the Placental Bird</h1>
        <p>Live-bearing placental birds could be considered the peak of avian reproduction, the first and only bird to
            completely remove itself from the constraints of the egg completely. Such an adaptation did not appear in a
            single step, however, but is rather the culmination of many adaptations developed by their ancestors over
            countless generations.</p>
        <h2>Ornkeys</h2>
        <p><strong>Ornkeys </strong>are a group of arboreal prosimian-like changeling birds native to Serina's tropics
            in the early Pangeacene. They are notable as being the most primitive living placental birds, likely very
            similar to the common ancestor of all modern species.</p>
        <p>Female ornkeys produce very small (about .5 cm diameter) and soft-shelled eggs like other changelings, but
            fewer than most others, only between twenty and fifty.<strong> Most other changelings retain clutches of
                eggs in their oviducts for up to a day as they are produced, then releasing large numbers of them
                simultaneously. Ornkeys, however, retain their eggs for much longer, long enough that the eggs settle
                and implant themselves into the uterus of the mother and - within several days - hatch
                internally</strong>. It's likely than in an even earlier ancestor to the ornkey, these babies would then
            be born as per usual, simply as newborn larvae. The ornkey, however, has already evolved beyond that first
            stage and its young are not immediately voided but retained longer still, feeding for the first day or so on
            their egg yolks during which time <strong>their tissues fuse with the blood vessels of its mother's uterine
                lining, providing ready access to nutrients and oxygen in the motherâ€™s blood and the facilitation of
                waste removal</strong> so that they continue to receive nourishment even after their food supply is used
            up. The embryos are then retained in their bodies for several more weeks while they develop and are
            nourished by the parent through the earliest stages of their life cycle, so that by the time the young
            finally lose their tie to the parent and are born, <strong>they have skipped the bulk of the larval stage
                altogether.</strong> Their eyesight by then is thus already acute and their arms and legs are both
            well-formed and able to climb, jump, and walk, so that even though fewer young overall will be produced in
            the end, they will all be more likely to survive. Though barely three centimeters in length at birth - still
            smaller than a great many insects - <strong>the babies are thus immediately capable of fending for
                themselves</strong> and are abandoned by their parent. They are carnivorous and begin to eat
            immediately, feeding mostly on insects and smaller animals that they could catch in the raptorial claws that
            line their wrists through a combination of ambush and active hunting in the branches. Some will succumb to
            starvation, unable to catch enough food, but the most successful hunters can eat up to its own body weight
            in flesh in a day.</p>
        <p>At this stage a young ornkey is still bald and featherless, however, and though <strong>its lungs are
                fully-formed and its skin is watertight</strong> it cannot maintain its own body temperature and
            <strong>is an ectotherm</strong>, relying on warm environmental conditions to survive. To avoid predators
            and hide from prey, it is often colored cryptically in green or brown for camouflage. <strong>Within a
                month, however, it begins to develop its first feathers in the form of a fuzzy coat of "peach fuzz" that
                covers its head, neck, and torso.</strong> By two months of age, the animal has put on substantial size
            as a result of its insatiable appetite and is now as large as a hamster - four to five inches in length and
            several ounces - and able to keep itself warm. It is also now well-feathered with an insulating coat of
            plumage and has become especially agile, leaping and climbing with great speed through the branches. Its
            hind legs are now nearly as long as its forearms, while <strong>the bones in its wrist have split into two
                grasping digits, each tipped in a curved claw, that give it a grasping grip on the branches</strong> as
            it moves through the canopy. By this time their diet broadens significantly to include not only animal prey
            but also fruit, flowers, and even the occasional bite of salad. Sometime between five months and a year of
            age, the animal has reached its full size of a few pounds and also now reaches sexual maturity, with males
            developing brightly colored wattles and exposed skin along their faces and brightly colored plumage.<strong>
                It is now completely warm-blooded and fully feathered, except for along its arms and legs which still
                sport bare, scale-less skin</strong>, but retains many aspects of its appearance from its infancy.
            Ornkeys have lost their flight feathers entirely, but retain a small patagia of skin between their arms and
            their torsos, as well as a propatagium in front of their arms, <strong>that give them some gliding
                capability.</strong> Their wrists have become more mobile than other birds, <strong>able to rotate and
                be pronated</strong>, to better provide a grasp in the canopy and the shoulder has become more flexible
            with a range of motion near to 180 degrees, <strong>enabling the bird to brachiate.</strong></p>

        </figure>
        <p><strong>Birds like the ornkeys are considered to be the direct ancestors of all other placental
                birds</strong>, which built upon the adaptations gained by their ancestors and adapted to retain their
            offspring for longer in the womb so that they could be born at an even more developed state. Approximately
            twenty-five million years ago, one group of ornkey-like changeling birds began specializing toward a more
            herbivorous diet of leaves and twigs. They grew larger and developed a bulky stomach to better process it.
            At first their young remained carnivorous, transitioning gradually to a vegetarian diet with age, but as the
            adult grew larger they became able to retain their young internally for much longer. Chicks were now born
            fully feathered and already able to digest the plant-based diet of the adults. As the adults became more
            herbivorous, they were no longer a potential predator to their own offspring, and it would benefit young to
            stay near their mother for protection; over time, the mothers began to guard their young, protecting them
            from predators and indirectly showing them how to find food. They began to cling to their parents' backs and
            even to take food that spilled their mouths while they fed. </p>
        <p>Over time, some of the tree-dwelling herbivores became so large that as adults, they had an easier time
            feeding on the ground. To protect their claws, <strong>they walked on their knuckles</strong>, foraging on
            the forest floor and in grassy clearings. As they spent more time on the ground and their wrists specialized
            towards supporting weight at the expense of a gripping hand, <strong>they split into two groups</strong> -
            smaller, long-legged, leaner species which could flee from predators, and bulky, heavyset forms that used
            aggression and size to deter most of their enemies. The former produced forms akin to deer and antelope,
            with extremely elongated wrists and highly reduced knuckles protected by fleshy shock-absorbing pads and
            digitigrade hind limbs well suited to a cursorial lifestyle. To survive on the plains, where cover was
            minimal, they retained their offspring for even longer, giving birth only when their young were sufficiently
            developed to be able to walk and run alongside them almost immediately. The latter group meanwhile came to
            resemble avian gorillas, ground sloths, pachyderms, and bears, with plantigrade feet and large powerful
            bodies. Because they were less specialized to run, their claws remained and the forearms remained less
            specialized, which also meant their young did not need to be quite as able to run for themselves at birth -
            they could still use them to cling to the mother's back during a prolonged period of dependence. A few
            returned to their hind legs as faculatative bipeds, using their claws for defense and to assist in feeding.
