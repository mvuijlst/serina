        <h1>The Puddlebud Tree</h1>
        <p>The <strong>puddlebud</strong> is a sunflower tree <strong>closely related to the wellwood </strong>which can
            be found across the edges of the interior desert, where grassland gives way to arid scrub. Like the
            wellwood, <strong>its growing stems eventually split open and form into a bowl-like structure</strong>, but
            the puddlebud <strong>does so every time a stem flowers</strong>, after which it branches below the split
            and repeats the next time the stems flower so that over many years, it exhibits dozens if not hundreds of
            small bowls at the ends of its branches, all of which face up to the sky. The process occurs much more
            quickly in the puddlebud because the puddlebud does so for a different reason; while the wellwood uses its
            "well" to collect nutrients, the puddlebud, as its name suggests, collects water during intense but very
            infrequent desert rainstorms, <strong>filling each of its miniature wells with rainwater that is quickly
                absorbed into the stems</strong>. Functioning like rain barrels, the puddlebud's many bowls can collect
            far more water than its roots could alone, and furthermore can store it for longer after the rains stop
            <strong>by secreting a greasy film from glands in its stems which floats on the surface of the puddles and
                retards evaporation until all of the water can be taken into the plant's tissues</strong>, which are
            pleated and able to swell with many times their weight in water when times are good to hold the tree through
            long droughts. The system is so efficient that during the seasonal rains, the tree often absorbs as much
            water as it can and still has a great deal left over in its bowls, which it can then retain by increasing
            the production of the slimy protective agent until it forms thick curds on the surface of the water
            <strong>so that each of the trees' branches contains a small cup of water sealed under a plug of
                mucous</strong>. When the dry season rolls around and other plants are feeling the strain of drought,
            the puddlebud is doing just fine while sipping from its stores as needed, and may even be putting out
            flowers, which open at night and are pollinated by birds and beetles. Its leaves are evergreen and do not
            shed even in the summer. Instead, they are thick, waxy, and protected from desiccation by a layer of minute
            hairs, though these lack the irritating sting of their cousins.</p>
        <p><strong>The puddlebud becomes a literal oasis in the desert during the height of summer</strong> when other
            water is in short supply. Birds learn quickly to pop a hole in the dried mucous caps of the tree's
            water-storing cups to access the life-giving liquid, and once they do so, specialized gnat-like flying ants
            lay their eggs in the cup. Their larvae mature there, feeding on microorganisms and the mucous cap produced
            by the tree, and may do so even in the height of summer when conditions are at the harshest and
            driest.<strong> It thus becomes its own microcosm of life</strong>, a tiny Eden in the desert that allows
            the survival of animals which could otherwise not remain there for most of the year.</p>

            <figcaption><strong>above:</strong> a mature puddlebud tree. Each bowl present on the tree was once the site
                of a flowering stem. When the flower went to seed and died, the stem around it, having lost its terminal
                bud, developed into the characteristic bowl shape while new leading shoots sprouted from the sides.
                During the dry season, the bowls will be filled with water, which the plant seals in with a protective
                mucous cap that prevents it being lost to evaporation.</figcaption>
