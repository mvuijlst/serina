        <h1>Burdles</h1>
        <p>Some of the most abundant marine birds which can be found in the warm oceans of the Pangeacene are
            the<strong> entirely aquatic, sea turtle-like descendants of the maritime muck</strong> known as
            <strong>burdles</strong>. Completely featherless, covered in scaly hide and with mesothermic metabolisms,
            while some of these strange birds returned to the land full time to give rise to large terrestrial
            herbivores, by far the more successful group by 228 million years PE, following the success of changelings
            and tribbetheres in herbivorous niches, is a branch which specialized in the opposite direction, becoming
            more aquatic and nearly severing their ties to land. Their wings become even more adapted into large
            paddles, which the bird used to power its movement in the water, while the sprawling hind limbs shortened
            into steering flippers and moved to the extreme rear of their bodies. These unusual aquatic birds now glide
            lazily through all of the warm seas across Serina, feeding on a variety of easily-obtained food sources that
            don't move too quickly to catch, from water plants to jellyfish - diets which can both be found in abundance
            along Serina's various reef-types and aquatic grasslands, which all support their own endemic varieties of
            aquatic muck.</p>

                <p><strong>above:</strong> two jelly-eaters, a group of carnivorous burdle with specializations to feed
                    on jellyfish, feed on their preferred prey. In addition to grazing on the edges of defenseless
                    chainjelly colonies (above), these leisurely hunters also tackle much more formidable stinging prey
                    (below), their throats covered in a defensive armor of keratin spikes that serve both to guide their
                    gelatinous food down the gullet and protect their throats from stings.</p>

        <p><strong>Burdles now find all of their food underwater and even drink seawater</strong>, ejecting the excess
            sodium as a caustic spray extruded from specialized glands in their nostrils. Living in the tropics and
            further insulated by thick layers of muscle and body fat, they can produce enough warmth through their
            movement that they do not need to haul themselves on land to bask. The only time that a burdle must return
            to land at all is to lay its eggs, and thus only the female ever does so. Like a sea turtle, she frequently
            returns to the same beach from which she herself hatched and deposits a clutch of eggs into the sand, which
            will hatch alone in the world and make a mad scuttling dash to the sea on their bellies, between predators
            and obstacles, which only a small percentage will likely complete. In order to lay all of her eggs at once
            to a single trip ashore, she stores them as they are produced in a special pouch branching off her oviducts.
            Producing three daily, it takes her up to two weeks to lay her full clutch. <strong>Her eggs have become
                soft-shelled so as not to crack as they are stored.</strong> The consequence is that the embryos cannot
            leech as much calcium from their eggshells in development and thus, as in bumblets, the young hatch out with
            <strong>highly cartilaginous skeletons which ossify in the months following hatching. </strong></p>
        <p>Most burdles are solitary animals, particularly those which are carnivorous, and are largely indifferent to
            their kind except to mate. <strong>Some grazing species, however, are highly social and move in large herds
                for protection.</strong> Though there is no active parenting in such species, as none would recognize
            their chicks even if they met, the younger and more vulnerable individuals stay close beside their older
            peers in an effort to dissuade their predators from approaching. Newly-hatched individuals often gather in
            swarms underneath the bellies of their elders for protection against seabirds, while yearlings - less
            vulnerable to airborne threats but still easy pickings for aquatic hunters, ride just on top, to help
            prevent an ambush from below. </p>
