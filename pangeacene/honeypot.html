        <h1>The Honeypot Tree</h1>
        <p>The <strong>honeypot</strong> is a small low-growing shrub <strong>closely related to the wellwood tree and
                the puddlebud</strong> which can be found in Serina's tropics in the Pangeacene, where it colonizes bogs
            and wetlands. <strong>It is more derived than either of its relatives</strong>. It is notable for its very
            stunted size, in comparison even to the puddlebud and especially the wellwood and lack of a pronounced woody
            trunk. Instead, it grows as a many-stemmed bush, low to the ground, attaining a maximum diameter of its
            branches of about an inch and a half and a maximum height of six to seven feet. Plants are typically wider
            than tall, up to ten feet around, and sucker from their root systems, further expanding their size. </p>
        <p>As do other members of its family, <strong>the honeypot's branches have a tendency to form a cup-like
                structure when the leading stem is terminated after producing a flower stalk.</strong> While new
            branches then spring up from below it, the stump becomes hollow and widens into a bowl. The bowls of the
            honeypot, due to the thin diameter of its stems, are only one to three inches wide, but become very deep,
            the stem hollowing out up to twelve inches down. <strong>Like those of the puddlebud, these structures
                naturally collect water.</strong> This is not their primary function, though for the honeypot typically
            grows in damp, saturated environments where drought is not a concern. Rather, once the plants' pots are
            filled, <strong>it begins to extrude a sugary sap solution from glands located inside the stem which lures
                in pollinating insects and gives the bowls a faint fruity aroma. </strong>Beetles and ants alight on the
            edge of the bowl, mistaking it for a flower, and head downward toward the source of the fragrance. But the
            edge of the cup is smooth and affords them little traction - <strong>as they cross the threshold, they slip
                and fall into the water below.</strong> There, in the honeypot's resevoir, they drown and decompose,
            <strong>the stem absorbing the broken down nutrients as they are made available. </strong>The honeypot does
            not produce digestive enzymes, but relies on the natural process of decompositon to break down its victims,
            and <strong>is thus not technically considered predatory</strong>, though as it does attract and derive
            nutrients from insects, it could be considered <strong>protocarnivorous.</strong></p>

            <figcaption><strong>above:</strong> a branch of the honeypot tree showing pitchers in two stages of
                development. A mature structure is visible to the left, with a second developing from the offshoot to
                the right, showing that this stem flowered and set seed sometime within the past year.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>The ancestral form of all bowl trees - including the wellwood, the honeypot, and the puddlebud - <strong>was
                likely a long-lived detritivore like the modern wellwood which didn't develop its bowl until late in
                life.</strong> The puddlebud represents an intermediate stage, being smaller and quicker to develop its
            adaptations, while the short-lived and bushy honeypot<strong> can be considered the most evolved member of
                the group</strong>. It first flowers - and thus its stems begin forming into bowls - by just a year of
            age - a rate of development one hundred times that of the wellwood, which in turn takes at least ten times
            as long to mature as a puddlebud. Its seeds are very similar to the crops of nuts produced by wellwoods
            except smaller, and their seed coats covered in sharp spines to dissuade hungry animals, since it does not
            produce as many as its larger relatives and thus can afford to waste fewer. The seeds of the puddlebud, not
            surprisingly, are also of an intermediate character, with small thorns. <strong>The puddlebud's desert
                adaptations have modified the form of its foliage into thick succulent leaves very unlike the ancestral
                form</strong>, but those of the honeypot <strong>are very similar to those of the juvenile wellwood and
                are armed with the same histamine-producing spines to dissuade herbivores.</strong> Because of their
            relatively harsh growing environment in bogs and swamps, however, which is relatively unattractive to
            browsing animals, the strength of the honeypots' sting is normally less severe. An exception is in the
            upland honeypot, or <strong>meadow scourge</strong>, a subspecies even smaller than the common form which
            grows in low-lying meadows and grassy areas where grazers are numerous. As can be inferred from its name,
            <strong>the sting of this form is especially intense, resulting in itchy red welts wherever unprotected skin
                comes into contact with its foliage.</p>
