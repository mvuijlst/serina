        <h1>240 million years: Life of the Late Pangeacene</h1>
        <p>Another 12 million years have passed, and Serina is now nearing the end of the Pangeacene. <strong>The large
                global landmass which so gave this epoch its name has begun to divide into two major continents</strong>
            which are drifting apart once again across the surface of the world of birds.</p>
        <p><strong>The climate becomes overall wetter</strong> as the large landmass breaks up, causing the harsh
            interior desert to recede slightly. As vegetation continues to absorb the great quantities of carbon
            released during the highly volcanic Thermocene-Pangeacene boundary,<strong> Serina also continues to
                cool</strong>. Significant snowfall becomes more frequent in temperate regions and a small ice cap
            begins to form over the southpole. The belt along the equator which supports tropical forests shrinks back,
            though only by a few degrees of latitude for now. <strong>Volcanism overall remains low through the end of
                the Pangeacene</strong>, even as the continents shift and break apart, though earthquakes - some of very
            large scales - and isolated volcanic eruptions <strong>will cause localized extinction events over the next
                few million years. </strong></p>
        <p>As the climate returns to a cooler state, <strong>life must adapt or perish</strong>. Many species of
            tribbets and ectothermic birds that truly cannot handle cold winters shrink toward the equator along with
            their habitats, but at least a few representatives of most groups will adapt to survive in a changing
            climate, evolving to hibernate or otherwise go dormant through the cold seasons. Most
            <strong>tribbats</strong> have so far failed to adapt to cooler regions, likely due to the constant
            dependence of most forms on the availability of fruits, but vagrant predatory forms begin to spread north
            and south. At the end of the Pangeacene the first truly <strong>cold-adapted tribbetheres</strong> appear
            out of the molodont clade, with thick fur to insulate them against snow and wind.
            <strong>Circuagodonts</strong> begin to diversify dramatically into many distinct genera, some of which
            begin a reversion toward a more omnivorous diet. <strong>Razorgrass </strong>savannahs are in a rapid
            decline as a result of circuagodont grazing and more abundant rainfall that allows the growth of more
            competitive puffgrasses. </p>
        <p>Many of the<strong> serezelles</strong> and other herbivorous, cursorial and quadrupedal changeling birds
            which proliferated at the beginning of the Thermocene have now died out,<strong> displaced by molodont
                tribbetheres</strong>. A handful of relic species persist in the tropics, though their long-term
            survival is uncertain, but more successful have been clade of carnivorous forms that resemble a strange
            admixture of antelope and storks called <strong>spearrunners</strong>. They are believed to have evolved
            from a serezelle-like bird which existed before the appearance of the circuagodonts and supplemented an
            herbivorous diet with insects and small animals during the dry season when razorgrass dominated the open
            plains across most of the interior. Like the ancient takareweas of the Kyran Islands, they hunt by running
            down their prey and catching it in a long pointed bill, usually swallowing it whole.</p>
        <p><strong>Cooling polar regions result in a productivity boom to the sea</strong>, as polar phytoplankton
            blooms support more and larger species of <strong>dolfinches</strong> and other marine animals than existed
            in the warmer, less productive seas of the earlier Pangeacene. </p>
        <p><strong>Myrmecophyte forests</strong> meanwhile <strong>are undergoing another evolutionary
                breakthrough</strong> as the bond between sunflower trees and their ant symbiotes becomes increasingly
            intertwined. A new group of ant trees is evolving which take the symbiosis to what may be its pinnacle, with
            both the tree and its insect partners now completely dependent on each other for survival. <strong>They have
                in effect become a superorganism</strong>, linked from birth to death, a hybrid of plant and animal with
            a complex life cycle unlike anything before seen on Serina. </p>
        <p>Lastly, <strong>intelligence has arisen near the equator</strong>, as a culture of social, tool-using
            predators begins for the first time to question the world around them.</p>
        <p>Evolution marches on as we reach the end of the Pangeacene. As temperatures on the world of birds go down,
            the <strong>derivity of the natives rises ever higher.</p>
