        <h1>Biome: The Sunflower Barrens </h1>
        <p> <strong>Sunflower barrens</strong> are a sort of biome-in-progress, a rather unnatural and impermanent
            forest type that won't last indefinitely. With the soil around them inhibited from colonization by other
            plant species due to the toxic tannins released by plants of the sunflower family, these woodlands are more
            the result of the sunflower's adaptable nature in an environment without competition than a lasting
            ecosystem type; until other plant species come to better tolerate their presence in the soil, they are
            abnormally lacking in floral biodiversity and subsequently that of animals too - thus their common name. For
            much of the year they're virtual green deserts - alive, beautiful, but almost wholly lacking in food, with
            only a small number of insects feeding on the foliage in turn providing food for a relatively poor bird
            population. Outside the autumn crop, drawing in a brief flush of migrants off the grasslands, they're
            inhabited permanently by almost no animal beyond occasional wanderers from adjacent forest or grassland
            environments. The plants are coarse, fibrous, and irritating to the digestive tracks of all but the most
            specialized herbivores, of which there are still fairly few in regards to birds - and in winter, when the
            petals fall and the leaves wither, the dried stalks offer little shelter from wind or weather.</p>
        <p> Among the only permanent residents of any note are various species of large <strong>mole-crickets</strong>
            which fill the approximate niches of rodents, nibbling on roots and tubers underground through the hard
            times and gathering sizable stores of fallen seeds in subterranean caches when they come available. Unlike
            most crickets today, Serinan species often live several seasons, thus their large sizes, provided they are
            able to nestle deep enough in the soil to avoid frost in more temperate climates. Even if they are killed in
            winter slumber, however, most species will have bred by the end of their first summer, leaving their eggs in
            the dirt to hatch and begin the next generation with the coming of spring. For the few birds that nest in
            the sunflower barrens a healthy breeding season depends on the size of the spring hatching and subsequent
            migration of young mole-crickets, which occurs en-masse above the ground. The crickets, which hatch at just
            under a centimeter in length, have evolved to all emerge at once and swamp their predators with the hope
            that a few individuals manage to survive and spread out to new territories successfully in the confusion,
            with over 95% of hatchlings being taken in the first two weeks of the hatching season. Hatching occurs at
            any time in the spring following two to three weeks of steady warm temperatures, but if there has been a
            poor crop of seeds the prior autumn many adults may not have been able to take in enough protein to breed
            and the following year's hatching will be small or non-existent. In these poor years, which occur often
            every ten years or so, many nestling birds, with their eggs incubated intentionally to hatch them out at the
            same time as the crickets, will starve to death before the next glut of insects in the form of less hardy
            beetle larvae and aphids awaken several weeks later.</p>
        <p>The sunflowers, though they bloom only for a short three-week window in mid-summer, nevertheless produce so
            much pollen and nectar at once during this brief flush that entire colonies of a few specialized species of
            <strong>honey ants</strong> - an ant clade which have become more or less stingless bees in the absence of
            the real thing - are able to make a living within the forest, storing up their entire years' worth of food
            during this time thanks to workers which are hatched only weeks before the predicted bloom and which die
            almost immediately after the petals wither, ensuring that they use as little of the precious food as
            possible after gathering it, to feed the queen. Alongside a small number of flightless workers, she will
            then bide her time until the next summer, with the queen, large and immobile in adulthood, doing little more
            than lying in near-dormancy for most of this time as her housekeepers maintain the integrity of the burrow.
            Due to the extremely short duration of the food supply and the need to reserve it so meticulously throughout
            the rest of the year, the queens of species that survive in this habitat only lays eggs twice per year - one
            series of clutches before the bloom which will hatch to become the flying food gatherers, and one right
            after, which consists of fertile drones and new queens which will gorge on the season's harvests before
            flying off to mate and settle into their own new colonies, taking with them in specialized baskets upon
            their hind legs just enough pollen and honey for the female to rely on until the next spring. A surprise
            lies in store for the males shortly afterwards, whom after choosing a mate and constructing their first home
            together in a patch of soft soil, will mate her only once before being cannibalized and fed upon, his body
            providing the boost of protein she will need come spring to lay her first clutch of eggs. Stored sugars
            within subterranean honey ant colonies in the sunflower barrens are among the only rich food source
            available for animals outside the seeding season and are occasionally pilfered by opportunistic
            sweet-toothed birds that pass through the barrens outside of choice season - they are spread out and often
            difficult to locate, however, and do not make up a significant part of any one creature's diet, with no
            creature beyond a few other small arthropods (such as the nest-parasitic <strong>Dew-drop beetle, a cuckoo
                ladybird</strong> which favors this species as a host, eating both their eggs as larvae and their sugary
            food stores as adults) specialized to feed from them. </p>
