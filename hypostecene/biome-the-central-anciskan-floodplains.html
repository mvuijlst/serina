        <h1>Biome: The Central Anciskan Floodplains </h1>
        <figure> <img src="images/d8nfcd0-dbc50ff7-1670-4e78-a3be-28e5098ee5d5.png" alt="map of serina 10MY PE" />
        </figure>
        <p>The world of Serina 10 million years PE is a warm, rich, and prospering one. Birds, insects, fish, grasses
            and flowers have speciated explosively to fill the ecological vacuum of their new world, forming a myriad of
            rich biomes worldwide both familiar and entirely unique to this world. With a climate that is tropical in
            all but the most polar regions - with even these being only equivalent to the temperate broadleaf forests of
            Earth - conditions are at this time ideal for colonizing species. However, Serina's current mild climate
            comes at a price - global rainfall levels during the Hypostecene, particularly the latter of the era, are
            considerably lower than those on Earth, a result of relatively flat and comparable thin landmasses over
            which air flows rapidly, with storms often by-passing land entirely, blowing from one sea to the next before
            releasing rain. While Serina at this point still lacks widespread desert, a gradual trend began immediately
            following the abandonment of the planet towards aridity; following five to six million years of almost
            complete dominion over land, bamboo groves begin to recede to more coastal environments where rainfall
            levels are more sufficient to nurture widespread forest, leaving inland regions the domain of prairie
            grasses and flowering plants, among them sunflowers, clover, and dandelion derivatives, which are better
            adapted towards lengthy periods of drought. Rainforest or its equivalent is the rarest biome present on
            Serina, occurring only sporadically along shoreline environments or in the shadows of the moon's few large
            mountain ridges, where coastal clouds are trapped and their water collected. </p>
        <p>In central Anciska, however, there does exist one notable region of high rainfall occurring despite no major
            mountains in the immediate vicinity; due to the region's extremely low elevation - several hundred feet
            below sea level. Here one finds an enormous valley that is growing wider by the century as the continent is
            torn by continental drift, being gradually pulled apart into two by continental forces, with a significant
            fault line running directly through its center east to west - eventually, the landmass will have split into
            two, with the southern portion of Anciska colliding with the north of Stevhlandea, forming another large
            island continent. With the ground so low here, the plains of this valley are the final resting place for all
            rains from both continents, which gradually flow over hundreds of miles of savannah both north and south to
            settle here in the largest floodplain in the world. Bamboo flourishes here as do they highest diversity of
            flowering plants on Earth, several thousand charted species now diverged from clovers alone, which grow
            large and colorful in the absence of significant competition. Wetland-adapted sunflowers are present, but
            grasses are dominant here, with dense thickets popping up wherever conditions allow, providing food for
            countless small invertebrates and feeding and nesting habitat to tens of millions of birds.</p>

        </figure>
        <p>Towering above all fellows and feeding almost exclusively on the foliage of bamboo, some of the largest
            living land animals of this time are of this eco-region: three-hundred-and-fifty pound herbivorous
            behemoths, a megafaunal family known only on this continent, the <strong>Womblers</strong>. Standing up to
            seven and a half feet tall, they stand almost pillar-erect on thick-set trunked limbs, their bodies
            inflexible and towering; their once useful wings now entirely useless and almost completely absent, they are
            slow and plodding, very steady on their feet, for if they fall over they will find it most strenuous to
            right themselves again - and in boggy conditions, perhaps impossible altogether, though they are highly
            buoyant and able to float well in water. Though by megafaunal standards they're not huge, compared to their
            ancestors, which may have weighed less than three ounces, they have increased in size by several thousand
            times, and have inflated to such sizes at an unprecedented rate. Without predators to concern them, they
            have evolved no ability to move quickly and amble methodically, eating almost every hour of the day and
            night to provide themselves with enough energy just to survive on, using large and heavy-set shearing bills
            to cut shoots and stems, which are swallowed whole, to be broken down with gastroliths. They are more or
            less defenseless and nest upon the ground, hatching a single chick from a fifteen pound egg every third
            year, which is still entirely altricial and dependent on parental care, laying in a crude nest of grass on
            their bellies, unfeathered until almost five months of age and requiring warmth from the parents at almost
            all times, and gaping for food until it is over one hundred pounds - only then can its legs be developed
            sufficiently so as to support its weight - a weight it will take 16 months to reach on such a poor diet -
            almost entirely the shoots of bamboo - as it is provided. Even after it can stand, it will not feed itself
            adequately for more than another year, relying on its parents for its survival for a total period of almost
            30 months. </p>
        <p>Sexual maturity is not reached for another four years, though lifespans can extend a number of decades, for
            as adults there exists no land animal sufficiently powerful to harm them, save for one another; a lack of
            predator fear has gone hand-in-hand with a lack of fear for conflicts in this clade; while otherwise
            incredibly peaceable, males will fight one another to the death over females during nesting seasons, and
            even outside them, and will casually engage in lasting and potentially deadly battle for the most trivial of
            purpose simply as a matter of course; so intense are the fighting instincts of the males that, in a most
            ironic twist, despite having evolved to have no predators, male mortality is incredibly high, with 80% of
            all animals dying from fight-related injury, most commonly a leg shattered by a powerful blow of the
            oppponent's bill, before their twentieth birthday - a lifespan that females, much more docile and herding
            animals, may out-do by three times. It is so that the very lack of predators in the Womblers' environment,
            which require the evolution of a healthy and natural level of fear to survive alongside in a normal
            environment, have resulted not only in animals which have no predator fear, but no fear at all, and
            subsequently none of the natural inhibition of animals in more natural environments to avoid unnecessary
            conflict - to a wombler, every conflict must be fought, and there is no flight - only fight; it has been
            noted that the high-intensity intra-specific aggression of the male wombler draws very close parallels to
            behavioral disorders sometimes found in dogs bred to be low-fear; a lack of fear, without very careful
            management, can easily go hand-in-hand with a lack of fight inhibition, with the potential existing to
            produce truly dangerous animals.</p>
        <p>It should be noted that, like most birds of Serina, the instinctive tendency to sing, both in courtship and
            territorial aggression, has not been lost; male Womblers of most species are very avid singers, with their
            songs being almost identical on inspection to those of modern canaries but slowed down five to ten times and
            brought down several octaves, as if slowed with audio-editing software. The impression furthered by the
            throat and bill of the singing male, which move in equally slowed measure as if the live animal is being
            seen via high-resolution slow-motion film.</p>
        <h2>Axbills</h2>
        <figure><img src="images/d8ngwtx-e9779203-6c1b-4c54-90cf-8efe77ec1251.png" alt="axbill">
            <figcaption> -Order Passeriformes<br />--Family Fringillidae<br />---Subfamily Dromaeoserinae: "Running
                Serin"<br />----Genus Magnarynchus: "Giant Beak"<br />-----Species Illustrated: <em>M. imperator</em>
                (Imperial Axbill). </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p><strong>Axbills</strong>, which along with other birds of the <em>Dromaeoserinae</em> diverged from Womblers
            and others of the <em>Baroserinae </em>six million years ago, are a widespread genus of relatively large
            (bustard to emu-sized) flightless ground birds which feed predominately on coarse grasses and in which the
            male exhibits a considerably enlarged bill cask used in intra-specific display, but not combat, for the bill
            - while large and seemingly strong - is in fact very fragile and composed almost wholly of keratin. While
            both groups descend from a common flightless ancestor, the two groups have gone down different paths, with
            the Baroserinae having become overall large and stocky birds while the <em>Dromaeoserinae </em>have become
            more lightly-built and capable runners, for while Womblers and kin are sedentary browsers of stable
            environments, Dromaeoserins, Axbills included, are on the whole highly migratory animals of the open plains,
            adapted to cover very wide distances throughout the year as they follow seasonal rains and the flushes of
            green growth they bring to the savannahs. Found throughout Anciska and central Striata, flocks of the
            Imperial Axbill, the most common species of the time period, may cover over one thousand miles in a year in
            flocks several million strong as they follow the rains, relying on unknown cues to find them - it is
            possible their sense of smell may be of more use than most birds'. It is only when they find them that the
            normally highly gregarious birds will disband from their herds and come into breeding condition, with the
            males moulting from normally dull browns and grays into a rich attire or bright reds and yellows. Males form
            leks, gathering by the thousand in choice meadows and displaying, flashing their brilliant colorful neck
            patches and belting out lengthy and varied sequences of bubbly song, having the best chance of procuring a
            mate by having the largest and most out-sized bill casque - a signal that any male who can carry such a
            handicap and still survive must be of excellent genes - and most varied motif (every lady loves a little
            music to set the mood). A hen, her bill far smaller than her mates and her plumage less exuberant, will
            still likely mate with a number of attractive males, ensuring that of them all only the best manage to
            fertilize her eggs, which are laid in group of two (rarely three) directly upon the ground and incubated as
            well as fed solely by the hen; following the breeding season, males band together into large bachelor herds
            until the females return with young in tow several months later. </p>
        <p>While they have few predators, Dromaeoserins have nevertheless already undergone significant adaptations
            toward a precocial reproductive strategy in recent millennia as increasingly seasonal, dry climactic
            conditions mean that sizable quantities of food are impermanent and sporadic. As a result, a lengthy period
            of juvenile helplessness just isn't possible when food supplies in any one region may only remain for
            several months. While smaller flying birds can circumvent this by rapid growth from egg to fledgeling in
            only a few weeks, for a bird so large complete maturity is impossible in such a small time-frame, which is
            why Dromaeoserins are notable for hatching out of their eggs fully covered in soft down and able to stand
            and walk after only ten to fifteen days. While they will be dependent on their mothers for food and
            protection from the elements and predatory attack for far longer, as long as they are mobile the young can
            follow their parents to new pastures as they green to continue the rearing process elsewhere; some species
            of Dromaeoserins will even carry their young upon their backs, nestled in the plumage, when they are very
            young and unable to walk far on their own.</p>
        <p>Most Axbills, typical for the clade, are omnivores with a preference for plant matter, using their large
            beaks to tear grasses and fibrous flower stalks which consume only marginal quantities of animal protein in
            the form of insects and invertebrates, though young are offered considerable quantities of crickets and
            other meaty insects during rearing when rapid growth and development demands increased protein intake.</p>
        <h2>Aardgeese </h2>
        <figure><img src="images/d8ngwth-a006382d-8c9d-45e0-8455-0c770467a788.png" alt="aardgoose" />
            <figcaption> -Order Passeriformes<br />--Family Fringillidae<br />---Subfamily Dromaeoserinae<br />----Genus
                Solumornis "Ground-living Bird"<br />-----Species Illustrated: <em>S. vallivivus</em> (Valley
                Aardgoose). </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p> <strong>Aardgeese</strong> are basal, highly successful Dromaeoserins native to all major landmasses on
            Serina during the late Hypostecene with the exception of Stevhlandea and extreme southern Karii. Named for
            their flightlessness and diet of soft grasses and water plants, not for any tendency towards burrowing, they
            split off from the group very early on, relatively speaking, roughly five million years ago when the climate
            was marginally wetter, allowing these birds of floodplains and marshland to spread worldwide before becoming
            isolated to a number of smaller habitats surrounded by drier seasonal savannahs less conducive to their
            survival. By and large, they are conservatively colored, medium-sized flightless birds ranging from ten
            pounds at their extreme smallest to upwards of eighty pounds at their best, closely related to Axbills and
            very nearly resembling the ancestral form from which these and other more derived Dromaeoserins evolved
            from. Behaviorially, they are very alike others of their clade, though unlike Axbills, this species does not
            lek; instead males control small harems of three to five hens, the young of which he assists in rearing. The
            chicks of this genus are similarly precocial compared to other canaries, with this species too engaging in
            transporting the young upon the back. Aardgeese are predominately birds of terrestrial but near-water
            habitats but swim well, being plump and bouyant, and can cross rivers and lakes relatively easily thanks to
            their slightly webbed feet. While they can survive away from large sources of water and may cross large
            distances of dry land seasonally, they rely largely on high-protein algae and aquatic invertebrates to rear
            their young and do not breed successful in drier upland environments. Hens lay four to five eggs at a time
            but will rarely wean more than three, as the youngest is often bullied by its older siblings, for the hen
            begins sitting as soon as the first egg is laid, meaning this chick hatches up to a week before its younger
            relatives and often takes their share of the food. The nest is a simple structure of grass and dried mud
            often placed near water. </p>
        <p>Both genders of Aardgeese sing, the hen joining the male during courtship, though the song is comparably
            basic to the ancestral canary's melody and highly repetitive, a short series of three to eight whistles and
            clicks repeated with little variation. When startled or upset Aardgeese will honk plaintively and will growl
            and hiss if further pressed. Aardgeese are normally social flocking birds, though opposing males may battle
            during courtship season, kicking at one another with the sharp hind claws; these battles rarely cause
            lasting injury. </p>
        <h2>Stiltskins</h2>

                    purpurupectus</em> (Violet-breasted Stiltskin). </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>A portmanteau of 'stilt' and 'siskin', long-legged proto-wading birds, which range in size similarly to
            modern plovers, are found throughout most Serinan continents in a variety of habitats, particularly coastal,
            where they feed on algae, water plants, seed, and small invertebrates stirred up from shallow water or tall
            grass with the long legs and pointed bill. Still capable flyers, they are highly migratory in some locales,
            nesting far towards the poles and wintering near the equator. They breed near water in the branches of
            taller herbaceous plants, building a sturdy nest of twigs, and the young are typically altricial for
            songbirds, though born with a coat of down and with eyes that will open after only two days. Some
            <strong>stiltskins</strong> sing and some have largely lost this habit, their calls reverting to simple
            screams, chirps, and warbles. Most stiltskins are highly gregarious, breeding in colonies. There is little
            to no male-to-male aggression and the species is seasonally monogamous. </p>
        <h2>Galliwalts</h2>
        <figure><img src="images/d8ngwsv-1c8f3024-2a23-46da-9c5c-01e4184a467e.png" alt="galliwalt" />

                    magneurosa</em> (Big Red Galliwalt). </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p> Opportunistic omnivores, <strong>Galliwalts</strong> occur on all Serinan landmasses by the late
            Hypostecenic, derived from the same terrestrial, predominately plant-eating stock which would later give
            rise to both Baroserins and Dromaeoserins. While these groups would lose flight entirely, Galliwalts, which
            are generally no larger than turkeys, still retain it, albeit only on a basic level and for only short
            distance use, preferring to scratch around the soil for their food. Galliwalts eat mainly seeds, berries,
            and insects, but will also consume fallen nestlings, tender green shoots, and snails if the opportunity
            arises. Young galliwalts are less well-developed at hatching than the young of Dromaeoserins, but grow more
            quickly and can run at three weeks of age; fly at eight. Both the male and female care for the young -
            typically three or four - with males sometimes taking two mates at once, but frequently being monogamous for
            a given season. </p>
        <p>Male galliwalts attract mates with an extremely complex song sung while perched above the ground in an open
            space, in which they combine hundreds of different verses of both their own creation as well as sounds and
            calls mimicked from other birds and even insects. While singing, males add a visual aspect to their
            performances in the form of a large, divided throat pouch colored brightly blue and red which they inflate
            whilst singing - the same structure also occurs in hens, though considerably smaller, and hens will often
            sing, albeit less skillfully, during the height of the mating season if a male cannot be found, in hopes to
            contact one. They are extremely attuned mimics and both genders will also utilize the copied calls of larger
            predatory birds to frighten off smaller sorts that may harm their eggs or young. The hen and cock are
            typically very similar in appearance, with the male being marginally larger and slightly more colorful.</p>

        <p> <strong>Qualts</strong>, several species of which are also referred to as Galliwalts, are a genus of
            Undiquopterine ground canaries native to central and southern Anciska down through Stehvlandea, closely
            related to <em>Galliopteryx</em>, which approach more closely the flightless weight-to-wingspan barrier and
            which almost never fly, preferring to run around close to the ground in tall grass, eating mainly seeds,
            flowers, and the larvae of beetles. Behaviorally otherwise they are very similar, though the song of the
            male is much more simple and does not involve mimicking; hens sing rarely if at all. Nests are often on the
            ground in plain sight, though in predator-rich areas simple structures may be built in crudely-fashioned
            depressions in soft sand and hidden with foliage. Males typically mate with half a dozen hens and help
            assist them all in feeding the young, with the hens doing all of the incubating. </p>
        <h2>Shriekers</h2>

                (Common Shrieker).</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p><strong>Shriekers</strong> are a genus of thrush-sized, very bold and omnivorous canaries and among the
            earliest predators to evolve in the Serinan ecosystem; while today some forms have further specialized in
            this regard, basal shriekers remain as one of the planet's most adaptable and wide-ranging bird groups, able
            to survive in almost all habitats and able to consume nearly anything, from seeds to fruit and berries as
            well as insects, eggs, nestlings, and carrion. They are clever and aggressive birds that are particularly
            dangerous to other birds' nestlings, and they are very noisy and raucous birds with harsh screaming calls
            that can be deafening when the birds gather in large flocks. Males will mate multiple hens and help provide
            for them all to a minimal extent; the female builds the nest and incubates in a tussock of grass several
            meters above the ground. Nestlings grow and mature at a fast rate typical for small songbirds. </p>
        <h2>Canaries and Canary Thrushes</h2>
        <figure><img src="images/d8ngwru-853176bd-3d88-49b9-bea9-b8c937226589.png" alt="Canaries and Canary Thrushes">
            <figcaption> -Order Passeriformes<br />--Family Fringillidae<br /><span
                    style="font-family:Georgia">----Genus Serinus; Genus Siskus <br /><span
                        style="font-family:Georgia">-----Species Illustrated: <em>Serinus nigrensis</em> (Black-cheeked
                        Canary); <em>Siskus caudirosa</em> (Rosy-tailed Canary Thrush); <em>Siskus albus</em> (False
                        white-eye). </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p> The <strong>black-cheeked canary</strong> and <strong>rosy-tailed canary thrush</strong> are small
            sparrow-sized songbirds native only to the central Anciskan grasslands. Whilst many birds following
            introduction to the moon quickly diverged into distinct and new niches, a far greater number have kept to
            much more basal niches and appearances - very basic true finches, even of the same or very closely related
            genus to the ancestral canary, are widely abundant throughout Serina, with some species having changed very
            little at all fundamentally over the course of their evolution. The black-cheeked canary is a typical mostly
            herbivorous seed-eater with a melodious song which nests in low-lying clumps of grass and feeds its young,
            which fledge at 20 days similarly to other finches, predominately insects and seeds. The canary thrush, one
            member of a more widely spread bird genus, is like most of its new genus an insectivore, filling the niches
            of warblers and thrushes on Earth and consuming only minimal quantities of plant matter. The little
            <strong>false white-eye</strong>, another species of canary thrush, is similar, though preys more on beetle
            larvae, worms and gastropods, especially slugs, rather than adult insect prey, gleaning these from the
            undersides of leave with a particularly thin pointed bill. </p>
        <h2>Doodlebirds</h2>
        <figure><img src="images/d8ngwr7-47b3e58b-62ac-4e1f-be57-dd64b4dd0113.png" alt="Doodlebird" />

                Doodlebird); <em>A. volans</em> (Primitive Doodlebird).</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p> Serina's first true response to the overpopulation of ants, <strong>doodlebirds</strong> form a specious
            clade of borderline flightless (some species can flutter minimally, others are grounded with significantly
            reduced wings, even within the same genus) insectivorous canaries which have adapted to consume almost
            nothing but ants, both adults and larva, gathering the insects not only from their nests, which it disturbs
            by digging with its large clawed feet, moving away the sand with the wings, but simply running about the
            ground with long, thickly-scaled legs - to guard from bites - and up the stems of foliage, nipping up any
            they come across - thousands in a day. Typically no larger than a pigeon, they are commonplace in most
            environments but very easily missed, being very fast and subdued in color, able to disappear into tall grace
            without a trace in front of your eyes. </p>
        <p>Doodlebirds nest in dense thickets of grass at ground level, and rear their young exclusively on the larvae
            and eggs of ants, particularly honey ants. The young hatch blind and naked and grow quickly, though slower
            than smaller songbirds, fledging in 36 days, after which they run after their parents for another two weeks.
            During this time, parents will feign injury to lead would-be predators away from their young in a manner
            similar to killdeers. Doodlebirds are unique among Serinan birds of the era in that they form lasting pair
            bonds of several years to life, though they will readily take new mates should something happen to their
            previous. Male doodlebirds no longer sing so much as coo in the manner of doves; it is a pleasant, plaintive
            call, but only of a few drawn out notes. </p>
        <p>The little <strong>primitive doodlebird</strong>, as well as several related species, are as their names
            suggest the least specialized members of the genus, consuming significant amounts of beetles and crickets in
            addition to ants and being capable flyers for short distances. Larger species, such as the <strong>olive
                doodlebird</strong>, are entirely flightless, though can glide to an extent.</p>
        <h2>Dougals</h2>

                            Dougal)</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p><strong>Dougals</strong> are a diverse group semi-aquatic canaries that feed predominately on aquatic insects
            and water plants. Plump and stout, their bills are large and serrated, adapted to scraping algae, and their
            feet are webbed. Some of the first canaries on Serina to take the plunge into aquatic environments, they're
            awkward swimmers at best, not sure whether to use their wings or feet or both or neither for propulsion, and
            prefer to stay along the shoreline. Caught in flux, they're awkward on land, and even more awkward on water,
            though have some leeway for they are able to exploit a niche by feeding underwater that is otherwise
            entirely unused by other bird species. Some dougals still can fly, while others have lost the ability. </p>
        <p>About the size of a mallard duck, Dougals are still confined to a dependent altricial childhood, though not
            quite so much as ancestral canaries, with the chicks being unable to swim until three weeks of age, being
            hidden until then in a large rounded ground nest of grasses and mud in which the hen alone incubated the
            eggs. The male and female both feed the young, but the male is not generally a good parent and often leaves
            his hen for a new mate a few weeks after they hatch, leaving the hen alone to parent them. Six eggs may be
            laid, and if both parents help feed this many may fledge, but in cases where the hen must mother alone half
            of the young typically do not survive to this point. Dougals are interesting in that singing has been
            completely lost and the male has almost no courtship beyond a few simple chirps, simply jumping on the hen
            to copulate and affirming the pair bond in a most unceremonious manner. <br /> </div>
