        <h1>One Million Years Post-Establishment </h1>
        <p>Life is changing rapidly now upon Serina, as nature begins to try to balance-out its artificial environment.
            The canaries have spread to all major landmasses and adapted to a great variety of diets. For the first time
            for its avian inhabitants, notable predators are beginning to emerge. Having moved from egg-eating to also
            include pilfering of nestlings, the <strong>hook-billed egg-eater canaries</strong> are experiencing a boom
            in diversity, having spread to most continents, moving further and further south as local birds become wise
            to their hunger and become increasingly intolerant. In the bamboo forests, the snails begin to decline
            following the evolution of Serina's first social, highly aggressive carnivores - <strong>the ants.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Though only small and naturally docile ant species, predominately though not wholly of genus
            <em>Formica</em>, were introduced to Serina, it took only one million years for them to significantly alter
            their behavior. Without predators or significant competition, it did not take long for docile omnivores to
            turn to hunting, pillaging the nests of Serina's hapless ground-nesting birds. Their aggression grew,
            gathering in larger and larger swarms to overwhelm nestlings and eventually sitting mothers as well,
            desperate to protect their young. Their jaws became larger and more powerful as several species began to
            develop venomous stinging bites. The first wave of predators to hit Serina would be perhaps the worst - the
            <strong>Empire Ants.</strong></p>
        <p>Growing up to an inch in length, these large-jawed, meat-eating insects become a terrible curse to the
            planet's large, defenseless gastropods, overwhelming them by the millions and dismembering them
            piece-by-piece to carry as stock back to immense underground colonies composed of several hundred miles of
            subterranean tunnels. Within ten thousand years more, these most abnormally large snails will have been
            eaten all but to extinction, survived only by more reasonably-sized forms able to climb into the canopies to
            escape Serina's new apex predator. So too will be ravaged the unfortunate few large ground-canaries to have
            totally forgotten how to fly in their brief era of prosperity - it is no longer safe to nest on the bare
            ground, and those birds which cannot quickly remember to place their nests above it or learn to fight off
            the hordes will soon lose out in this game of life as their young are repeatedly destroyed by the world's
            new rulers. </p>
        <p>It is the ants which also now begin to take over the snail's role in the ecosystems. While the carnivorous
            <em>Formica</em> ants pilfer the snails themselves, they open up a path for the <strong>Leafcutter
                Ants</strong> to quickly take their place. Soon there will be no forest glade free of their eternal
            harvesting, as tens of billions of ants begin to fulfill the roles normally filled by a few million large
            ungulates. Originating in the tropical belt, they will gradually move further both north and south to take
            over a niche otherwise all but empty. Until vertebrate life catches up to them, thus ends the era of the
            snail and begins the age of the ants - but neither too can this glut last forever. As the ants proliferate,
            so too do the number of creatures that begin to view them as a source of food. The first creatures to do so
            are the predatory mites, which begin to infest the nests of the insects, devouring their eggs and young.
            Soon many creatures will follow suit as Serina's ecology attempts to stabilize itself to reasonable
            boundaries.</p>
        <p class="asterism">&#8258;</p>
        <p>Serina's meadows at this time begin to explode with color as a handful of clover and sunflower species begin
            to speciate at a remarkable rate. Initially both clades experienced a great drop in diversity, unable to
            compete with grasses and lacking natural insect pollinators. By now, however, a few surviving species of
            both have re-established in great numbers, pollinated now by either the wind - these plants being notable
            for a signifcant atrophy of their petals, which became of little purpose - and others by unusual ants which
            exhibit the peculiarity of retaining their wings throughout life. Like the leaf-cutters, these ants are
            entirely herbivorous, but they share a much closer relation to the Empire Ants as belonging to the
            <em>Formica</em>. Lacking the venomous stings or large mandibles of their relatives, the sweet-tasting
            <strong>Honey Ants</strong> become both a vital food source to many bird species, their unique ability of
            flight reversing an earlier trend towards flightlessness in the groups that begin to pursue them, and a
            life-line for Serina's flowers, now able to spread far and wide, taking their pollinators along, but which
            otherwise would likely have died out within the next few million years. Throughout damp regions worldwide,
            bamboo forests now climb to heights of over 130 feet.</p>
        <p>Below ground, a fertile soil has been taken over in the absence of moles by the invertebrates. Millipedes
            proliferate in the leaf litter of both meadow and bamboo glade, reaching lengths of half a meter or more.
            Also having taken to the soil are the crickets, which feed upon the plentiful starchy roots of the moon's
            plentiful grasses. Already they've begun to grow in absence of competition, with one species reaching a body
            length four inches long and the weight of a small rat. Growing up to twenty-five feet long, however, the
            <strong>Serinan Bullworm</strong> of the deeper subsoil is now the longest terrestrial animal on the planet.
        </p>
        <p class="asterism">&#8258;</p>
        <p>In the sea, an evolutionary arms race has begun amongst the live-bearing fishes, as the largest individuals
            begin to specialize in preying upon the smaller. The largest fishes alive are now <strong>pelagic
                swordtails</strong> over twelve inches in length with males carrying elongated tail swords of equal
            length. Magnificent and colorful, they are free to take display to extreme lengths, lacking predators
            themselves. Producing up to three hundred offspring every three months, which needn't survive the perilous
            period as eggs or larvae like many other fishes do, they spread rapidly across a sea abounding with
            opportunity, ravaging the hordes of small <em>Poecilids</em> that until now roamed with near-impunity in a
            world without predators. They are absent now only from the coldest of polar waters, where the most adaptable
            small guppies can still glean a brief reprieve from their hunts, though even here death is never far as
            these regions experience a boom in the population of cold-water jellyfishes taking advantage of this food
            source.</p>
