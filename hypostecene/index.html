        <p>Serina's atmosphere following the establishment of its ecosystem was very similar to Earth's, <strong>with
                oxygen at this time making up 24 percent of the atmosphere.</strong> The climate on the moon during this
            era was more tropical than Earth's currently and averaged roughly 70 degrees Fahrenheit, or 16 degrees
            Celsius. The temperate belts of the planet during this period were reduced in comparison to our own and the
            tropics extended further both north and south. Only the northernmost and southernmost regions experienced
            prolonged temperatures below freezing, and unlike Earth, Serina at this time would have had no permanent ice
            caps whatsoever. It would be a warm and mild garden world, ideally designed to accommodate its new children
            as well as was possible during their establishment upon the world. Lasting from 0 to 10 million years
            post-establishment (PE), this mild and prosperous era would come to be known as the
            <strong>Hypostecene</strong> - the "Foundation Era".</p>
        <p>Serina at this time would be made up predominately of a single super-sized, winding supercontinent known as
            <strong>Cirrus</strong>, which would remain together for less than twenty million years before the moon's
            high level of volcanism split them again. Composed of five individual landmasses connected by comparably
            thin land bridges, which run both north to south and east to west in a wide arc across the majority of the
            moon's face, these landmasses were known at this time as <strong>Anciska, Striata, Stehvlandea, Wahlteria,
                and Karii.</strong> In theory, by walking across them, one could move - without ever crossing sea - from
            one pole to the next. Though the various landmasses would soon after this era be pulled into increasing
            isolation, for the entirety of this earliest and most important time-span they would remain attached,
            permitting a smooth colonization and migration of all introduced fauna to spread out and thrive.</p>
