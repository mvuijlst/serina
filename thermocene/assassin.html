        <h1>Assassin Grass, Gluetrap Trees, and an ecosystem again in transition</h1>
        <p>We are now in the late Thermocene. Serina by this time has had more than one hundred million years of
            relative stability, with a stable climate well-suited to the long-term survival of many plant and animal
            groups. Now, however, a newly emerging plant group threatens to completely overturn everything, and it has
            only existed for less than one million years.</p>
        <p class="asterism">&#8258;</p>
        <p><strong>Assassin grasses</strong> are a newly evolving genus of tropical and temperate grass which have
            evolved a very dramatic and effective manner of reducing their competition upon the grasslands where they
            originate. <strong>They have evolved to produce a powerful natural herbicide in their leaf tissues to which
                the assassin grass itself has evolved immunity.</strong> The leaves of assassin grass are edged in
            small, fluid-filled beads which are easily ruptured, leaking a clear, odorless fluid containing the
            compound. The beads are popped easily by the movements of animals, but this isn't their primary function.
            Their main use <strong>is to be abraded and broken by the harder, silica-edged leaftips of other
                grasses</strong> when they come into contact, releasing the harmful agent which then bleeds freely and
            is absorbed into the competitor's leaf tissues, <strong>causing die back of the affected stems within
                several days wherever the assassin touches</strong>. The herbicidal agents at use are several closely
            related chemicals known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfonylurea"
                rel="nofollow">sulfonylureas</a>, which interfere with the synthesis of amino acids in most other plants
            which have not developed a natural tolerance, slowly causing them to wither and die. Though deterrence to
            herbivores was likely not the primary reason for the assassin grass to develop its defenses, <strong>an
                added benefit of the chemicals is that they are also potentially harmful to animals by inducing
                hyperglycemia - high blood sugar.</strong> Though the grass is not immediately toxic to animals and can
            be eaten in small quantities without lasting harm, grazers which feed extensively in areas where assassin
            grasses have displaced most of their competitors for a prolonged period of time are at risk of being
            sickened and eventually put into hyperglycemic shock. Animals would thus instinctively avoid assassin
            grasses all together unless they have exhausted all other available forage, leaving its growth largely
            unchecked and furthering its ability to spread.</p>
        <p>Because assassin grasses have few competitors and few animals feed on them significantly if given a choice,
            they can take over large tracts of open habitat and are a highly successful pioneer species, one of the
            first to appear and spread after natural disasters, such as fire or hurricanes, that clear large areas of
            other plant life. They have an effect too upon natural forest succession, for the young of trees and
            forest-forming plants experience extreme difficulty in establishing themselves in the presence of assassin
            grasses, which abrade their tender new leaves and poison them as they germinate and reach up to the
            sunlight. For the past half million years that the assassin grass has existed in its modern form,
            <strong>its offensive adaptions have given the assassin grass an extraordinary advantage over other plant
                life</strong>, so much so that across Serina many millions of acres formerly covered in diverse forest
            ecosystems have been displaced by at times seemingly endless prairies of this toxic invader, <strong>which
                may now comprise almost 99% of the floral biomass in some environments</strong>. Though the seeds of
            assassin grass are edible to birds, few other large animals can survive well in these environments, meaning
            that the prairies are a sort of ecological desert, <strong>destroying biodiversity wherever they
                spread</strong> and threatening a great deal of Serina's endemic plant and animal communities.</p>
        <p>Now, however, this is just beginning to change. <strong>Diversity is making a comeback</strong> as grasses of
            other lineages - grasses much more palatable to grazing animals - are returning to the plains, having
            <strong>evolved their own resistance to the toxic compounds</strong> produced by these new invasive species.
            <strong>A single forest tree has also emerged with a resistance to sulfonylureas</strong>. A member of the
            broad-leaved sunflower tree family, it superficially resembles a maple, with a fast growth habit, branching
            crown, and large lobed leaves. It produces edible seed pods favored by many woodland animals. Unlike some of
            it kin, it doesn't utilize ants for protection but rather produces a thick, sticky sap which insects
            struggle to chew into without gumming up their mandible or clogging their spiracles and suffocating, but
            which isn't inherently toxic and is easily broken down by the digestive systems of most higher animals.
            Aptly called the <strong>gluetrap tree</strong>, it is descended from a hardy understory bush which survived
            in the shade beneath the canopy and is thus able to germinate and survive even in tracts of dense assassin
            grass which block most light from reaching the soil beneath them. Able to sprout and develop slowly until
            they break past the dense crowns of the grasses and into the sunlight, forests of gluetraps then can grow
            rapidly, eventually producing their own thick canopy of branches which envelop the grass in shade. Adapted
            to the open plains, the grass cannot survive under shaded conditions and soon dies out, then freeing up the
            forest floor for the growth and establishment of other jungle trees including other sunflower trees which
            are involved in symbiotic relationships with ants. </p>
        <p>One type of plant which does not survive well in these forests, however, are the myrmecophyte bamboo trees,
            which are for the most part naturally adapted to be pioneer plants and struggle to establish themselves in
            the shade of grown trees; even types adapted to grow in the understory for a while as seedlings are usually
            displaced, eventually, by long-lived sunflower trees as a forest reaches it climax state. Across Serina, for
            the first time in more than sixty million years, <strong>the global forest ecosystem is beginning to
                experience new and significant change.</strong> The highly diverse bamboo trees, formerly Serina's
            dominant plant type, will be almost fully displaced by the sunflower trees over the next twenty five million
            years. Their decline will be rapid and dramatic, paved by the spread of the gluetrap trees, eventually
            leaving them to persist only in their most specialized niches. Some of the lucky ones which will make it
            past the <strong>sunflower tree speciation boom</strong> are the bamboo mangroves and their derivatives, the
            true sea bamboos, which have managed to exploit niches outside the ability of most of their competitors to
            survive. Ant symbiosis will survive in a degraded state within the sea bamboos, with the sea ant, and within
            some sunflower trees, which originally developed the mutualistic relationship for the purpose of competing
            with the bamboo ant-trees which <strong>will experience a dramatic decline of diversity across most of
                Serina by the end of the Thermocene.</p>
