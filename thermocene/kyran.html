        <h1>The Kyran Islands</h1>
        <p><strong>The Kyran Islands</strong> are a relatively small archipelago, predominately made up of tropical
            rainforest and grassland and approximately the size New Zealand, that is situated in Serina's southern
            hemisphere during the late Thermocene, roughly midway between the south pole and the equator. Situated
            perfectly between South Anciska and Stehvlandea to the west and Wahlteria and Karii to the east, it exists
            on a tectonic plate entirely its own and <strong>has been isolated for more than 150 million years, since
                before life was introduced to Serina</strong>. The island has moved southward through the eons since;
            now near the south pole, it gradually migrated from a northern location in the Hypostecene to an equatorial
            one in the Cryocene, sparing it from significant climate change that affected mainland ecosystems. Though it
            has shrunk in size over the years through the process of erosion and recently been further by rising sea
            levels, never since the introduction of life have <strong>the islands ever come into contact with another
                landmass</strong>. Like Borea in the late Thermocene, most animal groups which arose on mainland
            continents have never touched foot on the Kyrans. Uniquely, however, is that unlike the recently recolonized
            Borea, the Kyran islands have had an unsurpassed 150 million years for life to evolve in such an isolated
            state. Most animals on the Kyrans can be found nowhere else; though there are more recent immigrants from
            distant mainlands, carried by freak storms or oceanic adaptations, here <strong>numerous bird lineages still
                exist which have evolved in-situ, from the earliest canary colonists</strong>, for one hundred and fifty
            million years in brilliant isolation from the rest of the world. There are again no vivas here, nor
            serestriders, nor any other terrestrial megafauna so familliar on the larger continents which were at one
            point connected. <strong>No - here in the Kyrans, life has produced forms arguably even stranger.</strong>
