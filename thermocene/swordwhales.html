        <h1>Swordwhales of the Thermocene</h1>
        <p><strong>Swordwhales</strong> are significant ocean predators in Serinan seas by the Themocene, with smaller
            species surviving successfully through the acidification crisis at the end of the Cryocene and fairly
            rapidly evolving back into large predatory forms. Descended distantly from the <strong>Xiphophorus</strong>
            fishes (platies and swordtails) <strong>they fill the niche of sharks on Earth and broadly resemble a cross
                between a shark and a barracuda.</strong> Swordwhales have large, extensible jaws lined with dozens of
            sharp teeth, which are replaced throughout their lifetimes, and they are without exception carnivorous. The
            smallest species would fit into a modest home aquarium, while the largest are monstrous apex predators, some
            of whom can reach lengths as long as a school bus, and surely are capable of hunting almost anything they
            wish to in the sea. <strong>Swordwhales have large eyes and unlike sharks are predominately visual
                hunters.</strong> Most species feed predominately living prey and are fast and agile swimmers. They will
            feed on carrion if they come across it, but only a small percentage make a habit of regularly scavenging as,
            also unlike sharks, most of them lack a particularly keen sense of smell. </p>
        <p>Swordwhales were named for the appearance of their earliest representatives, <strong>some of which utilized
                an elongated lower tail fin to thrash through shoals of bait fish and stun them.</strong> Such forms,
            however, went extinct at the Cryocene-Thermocene boundary. The surviving groups which reclaimed the open
            seas were more generic small shallow-water predators which never developed such an adaptation. Modern
            hunting techniques usually rely on either ambush from cover or from underneath sediment, in which cases the
            fishes have developed flattened bodies and highly reduced buoyancy, or active pursuit in fast, agile open
            water predators, with the prey being caught in the jaws which are highly elastic and can be shot forward at
            rapid speed to grab prey. <strong>Swordwhales are ecologically diverse and make use of many different
                diets</strong>, however, in addition to fish; some groups have evolved crushing molars to smash
            shellfish, while others have even become parasitic, biting and twisting away small circular plugs of tissue
            from other large fishes. The largest species is an active predator, but species only marginally smaller have
            adopted filter-feeding techniques; their teeth absent or vestigial, <strong>they cruise along the surface
                and suck up whole shoals of copepods and shrimp with massive gapes.</strong></p>
        <p>With relatively large brains, <strong>the swordwhales could be considered intelligent among fishes</strong>.
            Some are even social, not simply in a shoaling way, but working in groups to hunt. <strong>They cooperate in
                team to corral shoals of fish into tight formations</strong> which can be more easily managed. There
            even existed a lineage of large, social swordwhale in which the female which guarded its young in the safety
            of a pack until they were large enough to fend for themselves. Unfortunately, this group did not survive the
            end of the Cryocene, with modern representatives migrating to sheltered coastal environments to birth their
            young before abandoning them to their fate. The babies are born entirely capable to fend for themselves and
            proportionally large to their mother in litters which can range from just a couple in some large species to
            ten or more in the smaller types. <strong>All swordwhales nourish their developing young via a placental
                tie</strong>, the first among the fishes on Serina to develop such a method of providing nourishment to
            their young after they left their eggs and thus to allow them to develop to a much greater size before
            leaving the mother's body. </p>
        <p><strong>Males have also developed a beneficial reproductive adaptation by evolving a penis;</strong> their
            gonopodium fin, used ancestrally to transfer their sperm and fertilize females, has become a mobile,
            extendable tentacle. Through a tube on the inside, their genetic material is transferred directly inside the
            female's body in true internal fertilization.</p>
