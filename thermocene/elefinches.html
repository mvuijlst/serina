        <h1>Elefinches</h1>
        <figure><img alt="elefinches" src="images/elefinches_by_sheather888-db4h0fk.png" />
            <figcaption><strong>above</strong>: Sunrise in the Kyran islands reveals a community of strange creatures
                beginning their day in the meadow. A large browser plucks small, sweet fruits from the tall branches of
                a tree with the aid of a pair of strange, dexterous tentacles upon its snout. Just behind, a pair of
                smaller grazers, exhibiting their own smaller version of the same appendages, pass by. These strange
                trunked birds, collectively known as elefinches, are the most prominent large herbivores across the
                archipelago that is the Kyran Islands.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Moving silently though the dark understories of the forests of the Kyrans as much as trotting conspicuously
            in great herds upon its savannahs are many species of large, flightless bird. From a distance, many might
            seem relatively ordinary. Like many birds which have evolved in island habitats rare in predators, they have
            lost their wings. Like the emu, the ostrich, or even the aardgoose across the ocean, they're largely
            plant-eaters, and they brood their eggs in the usual manner ancestral to Serina's birds and utilized by most
            on Earth as well - there are no live-bearing avians here. But a closer look at any one of these birds on the
            Kyran Islands will quickly reveal an attribute of these particular animals which <em>is</em> as wholly
            unique to they alone in the entire bird order just as the evolution of live-birth was in the vivas. Where on
            most other birds could be found a hard, keratinous bill or beak, on the <strong>elefinches</strong> is
            instead replaced by a fleshy snout; this alone isn't a wholly unique feature - though it has evolved only
            twice in birds - for it is similar to that of a serilope. Utterly unique to the elefinches alone, however,
            are <strong>an additional two mobile tentacle-like appendages, in fact extraordinary extensions of either
                nostril</strong>. These are utilized by the creature for myriad purposes; bringing food to the mouth,
            grooming, social display, even as a pair of snorkels for use underwater. Indeed, the paired trunks of the
            animals are certainly far more effective manipulators than the forearms which the group has long since lost,
            so much so that the elefinches seem not to miss their wings at all. Small and fast-running forms utilize
            their nasal appendages in place of their wings, spreading them to the side to aid in their balance whilst
            lumbering giants, twice as tall as a man and many times heavier, use them to pull down the branches of trees
            to secure succulent fruits and buds which would otherwise remain beyond their reach. </p>
        <p>Surely the only thing more interesting than the ways that the elefinches utilize their unique nasal
            appendages, however, is the history which led an initially ordinary colony of canaries - just like those
            anywhere else on Serina at the start of the Hypostecene, to go down such an evolutionary path to come to
            produce such an aberrant innovation. How, most people surely would be inclined to wonder, did the elefinch
            get its trunks?</p>
        <p>To find out, we must go back to the beginning, just a few million years PE, when the life on the Kyrans was
            still largely alike that across the rest of the world. </p>
        <h2>Elefinches: A Natural History</h2>
        <p>150 million years ago, perhaps one million pairs of domestic canaries of all breeds and colors were freed
            into the newly planted grasslands of a young Serina, and from there on out, things would never be the same
            again. The canaries were released in groups of about a thousand across approximately two thousand release
            sites to cover all habitable land. At least one of these releases occurred on the Kyran Islands.</p>
        <figure><img alt="canary" src="images/hbZptWE.png" />
            <figcaption>yellow domestic canary, similar to those introduced to Serina - including the Kyran Islands -
                150 million years ago.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Like many small birds marooned on islands before them, the Kyran canaries quickly adapted to exploit the
            resources of their new habitat. Flight, for many, became unnecessary without predators to worry them, and
            many birds rapidly developed proportionally smaller wings and larger bodies.</p>
        <figure><img alt="Posted Image" src="images/BrO2xOj.png" />
            <figcaption>1 million years PE: a plump, mostly herbivorous canary with reduced flight capabilities. Like
                many other birds of this early time, even with few predators, it has reverted to a dominant natural
                coloration over many generations of breeding which has largely removed most recessive color morphs.
            </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>A total loss of flight was the inevitable next step for many birds, and due to the isolated nature of this
            particular canary colony's habitat, it would remain relatively free of terrestrial carnivores for far longer
            than those on the mainlands, permitting the long-term survival of this first wave of early flightless birds.
        </p>
        <figure><img alt="Posted Image" src="images/gyaBnqA.png" />
            <figcaption>2 million years PE: a flightless, entirely terrestrial quail-like bird has evolved, which feeds
                on both plant and animal foods it can forage for on the ground.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>A variety of groups would soon radiate from these primitive ancestors, including large herbivores,
            defenseless creatures not terribly dissimilar to the womblers and similar early giants which evolved in
            mainland environments around the same time. But these birds were not the ancestors of the elefinches - no,
            this group would not stake claim on these niches for many more millions of years. At this time, their
            ancestors were headed down a very different evolutionary path, not as herbivores at all, but insectivores.
        </p>
        <figure><img alt="Posted Image" src="images/MA75Vh8.png" />
            <figcaption>5 million years PE: one lineage of flightless canary, now larger and longer of leg and bill,
                specializes toward feeding on insects, particularly the soft-bodied sorts that it can scratch out of the
                leaf litter of bamboo thickets and grass tussocks. </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>There were many birds competing on the Kyran Islands by this point, however, and resources once abundant were
            now limited. To avoid competition, this particular lineage of canary gradually began to forage by night,
            when most other birds were inactive. With sight of less use, its bill became longer and more sensitive to
            touch, so that it could be probed into the soil in search of worms and burrowing insects and locate hidden
            food sources. In effect, they came to resemble a Serinan kiwi bird. The wings became smaller still until
            they were totally vestigial, while the eyes - less necessary, became smaller, and its vision less acute or
            sensitive to color. To avoid predators now during the day, they begin to shelter in crude burrows. To dig
            these, the foot claws become larger.</p>
        <figure><img alt="Posted Image" src="images/dpOSnU8.png" />
            <figcaption>15 million years PE: a nocturnal insectivore, with poor eye sight but an acute sense of smell
                and a long, sensitive beak.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Once this niche was established, it was highly successful, providing a springboard for the further evolution
            of adaptations suited to finding food without sight. In some, the eyes became smaller still while the bill
            developed an extra sensitive covering of soft, rubbery tissue, retaining a hard nail only at the tip to
            grasp prey dug out of the earth. The legs became more powerful and the claws especially large and curved,
            suited to digging out large burrows in which the young could be raised to protect them from new predators
            and a slightly more temperate climate during the Tempuscene. The bill becomes broad and flattened as a
            shovel to move soil loosened by the claws, while whisker-like bristles appear on the face, further
            increasing the tactile sensitivity of the bird as it burrows and searches for food.</p>
        <figure><img alt="Posted Image" src="images/FQ1IWKq.png" />
            <figcaption>25 million years PE: A badger-like bird has evolved, well-suited to digging and finding food
                underground. Its eyesight is now almost vestigial, able to sense light and dark and movement, but little
                more, while its sense of smell is especially acute, with the nostrils having migrated toward the end of
                the snout. It is now exclusively active under cover of darkness.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Birds like this persisted in similar form for a very long time, having found a successful niche otherwise
            unoccupied by animals on the isolated archipelago. Eventually, however, a new form emerged which exhibited
            fleshy cilia along the tip of the bill, made of the same rubbery tissue that otherwise covered all but the
            very leading edge of the beak. These were connected directly to the nerves of the snout, giving the bird
            even greater ability to detect and capture prey by sensing the vibrations produced by burrowing worms and
            insects in the ground. The legs grew shorter and the body longer, to move through tunnels. Its tiny eyes
            give it vision that is heavily blurred and extremely nearsighted at best, but even these birds were not
            entirely without sight.</p>
        <figure><img alt="Posted Image" src="images/N0Wpg87.png" /> </p>
            <figcaption>75 million years PE: the bird is now almost mole-like and rarely comes above ground; its wings
                have been totally lost, without even internal remnants to show they ever were. Using its noodle-like
                nose appendages to pick up ground vibrations, it hunts for worms in elaborate underground tunnels, but
                also forages above ground at night.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Eighty million years after their colonization, a freak natural disaster would change evolutionary history
            upon the Kyran Islands forever as an asteroid approximately 600 feet in diameter strikes the largest island
            in the archipelago. Not large enough to cause lasting worldwide harm, small asteroids have struck Serina
            fairly frequently over the course of its history, usually crashing into the sea or burning up before
            reaching the ground. Due to the specific location of the Kyran impact, however, the event was highly
            destructive on a local level. Though the asteroid burnt up considerably through Serina's atmosphere, it was
            still sizable at the time it reached the ground. The impact created a shock wave sufficient to level most of
            the forests on the island and kill or maim any animal caught in the open across most of the region, except
            for those which were sheltered underground. The asteroid event effectively extinguished more than ninety
            percent of the Kyran's endemic bird diversity.</p>
        <p>The burrowers inherited the islands. Most of their competitors wiped out, if not by the impact itself then by
            the resulting loss of food and cover due to the loss of the islands' forests, the formerly nocturnal and
            largely subterranean birds were able to expand their horizons. Their eyesight quickly improved after a
            number of generations bathed in the sunlight of the surface world, but the reversion occurred too late for
            one aspect to be restored: color vision. Being entirely useless in the dark, the cones required to pick up
            colors were long ago lost, so that even once the birds became terrestrial and diurnal again, they remained
            color-blind. Nonetheless, as the forests recovered and birds began to arrive from distant offshore isles,
            some of the former burrowers remained, growing larger and adapting adaptations used in their former niches
            in new ways. The fleshy nose appendages mostly disappeared, but the bill itself retained its rubbery and
            flexible covering. Muscles had developed in the upper jaw which were able to move their snouts while rooting
            for food, and this continued to be the initial way that the former-burrowers found their food above ground.
            Their diets became more generalist, incorporating tubers, seeds, and fallen fruit in addition to
            invertebrates. Gradually, they started to pick food from the plants themselves. The soft tissue on the upper
            jaw extended past the edge of the beak, forming a mobile lip able to reach up and grasp food from branches
            above their heads. The beak itself became relegated to a broad plate on the upper and lower jaws; all food
            was swallowed whole.</p>
        <p>The first true elefinches - megafaunal terrestrial birds with flexible noses - can be said to have appeared
            around 90 million years PE, ten million years after the asteroid impact event, though the exact form to be
            considered the first is largely an arbitrary distinction.</p>
        <figure><img alt="Posted Image" src="images/mHhiN9R.png" /> </p>
            <figcaption>100 Million Years PE: one of the most basal elefinches, here a badger-sized bird which spends
                all of its time above ground, feeding mostly during the day. Its claws are still large but now blunt and
                hoof-like; its nose is long and flexible, and though it cannot see in color, it has developed obvious
                black and white markings on its face for communication. The eyes are larger and the whiskers on the face
                are reduced in size and number. It feeds on a variety of food which can be found in or on the ground or
                on low bushes, including fruit, nuts, worms and birds' eggs.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>From here on out, the elefinches diversified substantially, becoming the Kyran's most prominent large
            herbivores, though many species are still actually opportunistic omnivores. One group adapted its digging
            claws into ungulate-like hooves, specializing to feed on the open savannahs - and to flee newly arrived
            predators in the form of giant flightless shorebirds which colonized the island's impoverished ecosystem at
            the same time as the elefinches. But most importantly, they further adapted their noses. To reach higher
            food sources in the trees, their snouts became longer and more mobile. All the while, their nostrils
            remained at the very tips of their snouts, as they'd been in the burrowing ancestor. With the snout's
            interior already divided by two distinct channels, it was fairly easy for the nostrils to separate at their
            tips, eventually producing some forms with two distinct, and equally dexterous, trunks. The trunks served
            several purposes; they could be used to reach food and to manipulate the environment, but also provided a
            huge area of surface for the olfactory receptors, allowing elefinches an unrivaled sense of smell. The
            hollow chambers were highly conducive to amplifying sound; many of the group additionally developed a hollow
            crest from the upper jaw and extending to the back of the head to resonate their calls for communication
            over great distances. </p>
        <p>The bills of elefinches were now totally covered in soft, muscularized tissue, with horny portions of the
            beak only present at the tips of both jaws, where they were used to crop vegetation. The jaws themselves
            were, however, lined with small keratin teeth known as "tomia", which also occur in Earth waterfowl, and
            were the predecessor to the proper teeth of the serilopes. Tomia were useful for cropping grass and leaves,
            but their avian jaw structure inhibited an ability to grind the lower jaw back and forth to chew their food,
            meaning it has to be swallowed whole. Certain elefinches got around this and developed a mechanism to
            masticate their food before swallowing it by sliding their upper jaws forward on a hinge from the cranium
            (all birds exhibit a degree of cranial movement - it's particularly obvious in Earth parrots.) Elefinches
            can thus grind their food to a pulp before swallowing it, aiding the primitive, non-ruminating stomach to
            break down coarse plant foods. Unlike serilopes however, which also chew (but through a different mechanism,
            namely a muscular, toothed tongue and the roof of the mouth), elefinches do not have cheeks, and their
            method of eating is thus not quite as efficient, as some food may spill from the mouth during the chewing
            process. Even so, the end result is a net gain in efficiency versus simply swallowing their food whole.</p>

                natural shades of grays and browns, they use bold black and white markings on their heads for purpose of
                display. </figcaption>
