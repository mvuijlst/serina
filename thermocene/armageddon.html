        <h1>Armageddon: The Thermocene-Pangeacene Boundary</h1>
        <p>500,000 years more have passed since we last checked in on the world of Serina, and environmental conditions
            have become increasingly harsh and unstable. Serina sits now directly on the <strong>Thermocene-Pangeacene
                boundary</strong>, a period marked by extreme volcanism, widespread desertification, and ocean anoxia,
            which will last through the next 2.5 million years. </p>
        <p>The past few hundred thousands years have seen the formation of a huge mantle plume between Striata and
            Wahlteria. <strong>A massive series of flood basalt eruptions results</strong>, similar to the earlier
            Striatan traps event that kickstarted the Thermocene but now larger than anything seen so far in Serina's
            inhabited history. By the start of the Pangeacene - an epoch which, for most if its history will be
            characterized by the presence of one major super-continent on the moon and only a few smaller isolated
            landmasses - <strong>virtually the entirety of what remains of Striata will be buried up to three miles high
                under millions of cubic miles of magma.</strong></p>
        <p>The stronger eruptions resultant from the Wahlterian Traps, unlike the slower, more flowing eruptions from
            the earlier, sizable, but much less destructive Striatan traps, will periodically produce intense explosions
            and <strong>release huge amounts of dust and debris into the atmosphere</strong>. Following the largest
            eruptions, these atmospheric dust clouds have and will periodically continue to reach such concentrations
            that at times, they will become so dense as to block out the sun. The result, despite continued
            sky-rocketing carbon dioxide levels and uncontrolled global warming,<strong> is the appearance of major
                short-term cooling events.</strong> More than once, following particularly intense periods of volcanism
            lasting several thousand years or more, the north pole and all surrounding regions, including Borea and
            Polar Anciska, become locked in ice and devoid of plant or animal life. In some instances, these brief ice
            ages will last upwards of twenty thousand years - long enough for glaciers to form and even move towards the
            equator toward the northern most regions of the forming supercontinent. Several series of eruptions already
            experienced have been so large and powerful, and the quantity of dust they brought into the moon's
            atmosphere, that they have darkened the planet's sun in the northern hemisphere for months at a time. The
            aftermath of this, in conjunction with the complete extinction of terrestrial plant communities in
            far-northern regions, is the <strong>complete extinction of terrestrial ecosystems on any isolated
                landmasses north of the supercontinent.</strong> The ark of Polar Anciska and the isolated land of Borea
            are reduced to barren outcrops of stone.</p>
        <p>All the while,<strong> in between the most extreme eruption periods uncontrolled greenhouse gases result in
                extreme periods of heating</strong>. As the eruptions release countless millions of tons of carbon
            dioxide, each period of intense cooling is eventually replaced by one of even greater stifling heat as soon
            as the dust settles out of the atmosphere. The carbon dioxide continues to enters the oceans, worsening
            their acidity. Over the long term, temperatures on Serina continue to rise, melting all newly-formed
            glaciation and ice caps from polar regions and causing catastrophic rise an fall of sea levels.
            <strong>Marine temperatures reach deadly levels numerous times at the Thermocene-Pangeacene boundary, as
                high as 120Â°F in shallow equatorial seas</strong> - temperatures absolutely lethal to all life except
            extremophile bacteria. With the seas virtually lifeless across much of Serina by this time, surviving sea
            life other than microbes isolated to the small forms of algae, fishes and invertebrates able to survive in
            sporadic pockets of oxygenated surface waters in habitable polar seas, there is little to move nutrients and
            dissolved gases through the water column. The oceans, already anoxic at deep levels, thus become almost
            completely devoid of oxygen as a result of extreme temperature spikes near the surface. The carbon influx is
            even more destructive now than before following the complete shutdown of photosynthesis in the northern
            hemisphere and most of the global seas, meaning that very little can now be sequestered out of the
            atmosphere. </p>
        <p>During cold periods, life on Serina becomes uninhabitable anywhere north of the equator. Between them,
            temperatures all along the equator rise to more than 140 degrees Fahrenheit - fatally hot for almost all
            terrestrial life for prolonged periods. A <strong> 3 million years' long see-saw between between fire and
                ice wrack Serina's remaining remaining ecosystems</strong> to their cores in a period of intense
            climactic unrest that will come to be referred to alternately as <strong>Armageddon</strong>, where life
            must fight to survive what is seemingly the end of the world.</p>
        <p>Serina's southern pole, the regions which once were the lower portions of Stevhlandea and Karri, is the least
            affected region throughout Armageddon, <strong>but the climate even here is unstable and harsh</strong> for
            higher life compared to anything the Thermocene had to offer. Conditions are as well extremely seasonal,
            ranging from subzero to more than 110 degrees F, with ice ages bringing respite from the worst summer heat
            but worsening winters and the intermittent hot periods producing milder winters but extreme summer highs.
            The northern half of the southern habitable belt is largely arid desert, but coastal regions support limited
            life through oceanic fog and summer storms that blow in from the sea. True forests are by this time
            restricted solely to a thin band along the southernmost edge of the new supercontinent, <strong>which now
                performs more than 95% of all photoynthesis occurring on the planet</strong>. Until the end of the
            volcanic period, it will be the only ecosystem on the entire moon which still serves to sequester carbon
            dioxide from the atmosphere. <strong>Almost everywhere else, photosynthetic communities have been totally
                broken down.</strong> The seas reach a level of stagnation not seen since the start of the Hypostecene,
            while land at the equator is reduced to barren, sun-scorched desert, virtually sterile of the kingdom of
            life and that at the poles reduced to nothing more than solid ice in the cold times and algae-encrusted bare
            rock in the hot ones. <strong>The almost total loss, globally, of photosynthesis results in a substantial
                decrease in atmospheric oxygen levels</strong>. This is exacerbated further by the proliferation of
            extremophile anaerobic bacteria which produce toxic hydrogen sulfide gas in the steaming equatorial oceans.
            Together, and coupled with extremely high concentrations of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, such
            as methane released with the repeated thawing of polar ice caps, these events produce an atmosphere that
            could be considered downright toxic to a great majority of life. As if to kick the remaining life while it
            is already clearly down, <strong>the reduction of atmospheric oxygen results in a global thinning of the
                ozone layer,</strong> particularly along the equator but also near the south pole where the last land
            ecosystems cling precariously to life, allowing harmful radiation to reach the moon's surface and increasing
            the incidences of cancer and other deleterious mutations noticeably by the end of the era. Plants
            experienced a heightened rate of mutation, mostly negative, but persisted, <strong>offsetting high rates of
                radiation-induced infertility with even higher numbers of offspring</strong>, ensuring at least a few
            would survive. <strong>Remaining land animals were all but forced into nocturnal niches to avoid the harsh
                solar rays during the day time.</strong></p>
        <p>The Thermocene-Pangeacene boundary - <strong>a literal armageddon for life as we knew it </strong>- will go
            down as the most extreme, volatile, and simply devastating extinct event in the history of life as we know
            it - even more destructive than the Great Dying at the end of the Permian on Earth. <strong>More than 99% of
                life on Serina is obliterated over the course of three million years.</strong></p>
        <p>But the unrest would not last forever. <strong>The extreme south pole had provided a small but sustainable
                pocket of refuge</strong> for a limited pool of terrestrial and freshwater life, a small remnant
            population for sure, but one which contained among it a sampling of the varied tapestry of life which had
            evolved all across the world, each one having been pushed to the bottom of the world together as their
            isolated continents became one. Eventually, these continents would settle together and the magma plume would
            recede. As volcanism slowed, extreme climactic changes became milder. Freshwater released in enormous
            quantities from short-lived polar ice caps throughout the boundary period would begin to flow over the
            surface of the heavier and virtually stagnant saltwater, <strong>producing shallow rivers of pure, freshly
                oxygenated water</strong> down from polar regions toward the equator. <strong>Following the rivers would
                be the plants </strong>- algae from the northern islands, and a variety of flora from the southern
            refuge. <strong>Soon the sea would be overgrown with a carpet of green floating vegetation</strong>,
            floating on just this shallow layer of freshwater and spreading at a phenomenal rate. As they grew,
            <strong>they were sequestering the surplus of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere</strong>, releasing huge
            quantities of oxygen in its place. As they did so, temperatures cooled and rainfall returned to the equator.
            As soon as it did so, terrestrial grasslands and finally forest communities tentatively migrated back
            northwards from their final hold out in the south. Slowly, tentatively, but surely, <strong>life would
                recolonize the regions scraped clean at the end of the Thermocene.</strong></p>
        <p>The <strong>Pangeacene</strong> had arrived. </p>
