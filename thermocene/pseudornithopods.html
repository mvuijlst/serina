        <h1>Pseudornithopod Serilopes</h1>
        <figure><img alt="pseudornithopod serilopes" src="images/2ZLrcp7.png" />
            <figcaption> <strong>above:</strong> Though their common name may
                translate to "false bird foot" and their appearance is more reminiscent of the non-avian dinosaurs
                of a bygone era than any modern bird, do not be fooled; <strong>the pseudornithopod serilopes are as
                    much descendants of the canary as any other bird on their home world</strong>. Here a mother
                leads a very young chick through a temperate forest near Serina's north pole, just as winter has
                lifted and the buds and blossoms of spring begun to appear, providing abundant food just in time for
                the little one's arrival. Behind the pair a long-billed, poor-flying ground bird, a probing
                insectivore of the forest floor, is startled into flight by their appearance in the clearing.
            </figcaption>
            <p>Not all serilopes are as specialized as the ornitheres; rather, there exist a variety of lineages which
                diverged at different points in the group's evolution. Some still closely resemble the ancestral viva,
                though these have become rare and isolated over the eons. A greater number of groups are
                <strong>morphologically intermediate</strong> between these relatively primitive forms with large beaks
                and
                very little in the way of lips to speak of, and the most derived ornitheres and trunksnouts, with the
                underlying anatomy of their snouts heavily obscured by mammal-like soft tissues. These "in-between"
                primitive serilopes show a reduction in bill size and unspecialized grinding plates on the roof of their
                mouths and lining their tongues, though the structures are not mineralized as in the ornitheres and some
                other advanced serilopes. They are able to grind their food before swallowing, but have not evolved
                beyond
                the precursor to cheeks to hold in the bolus; <strong>their mouths are lined, however, with thick fleshy
                    lips that in some other lineages did evolve into such structures as well as into the strange trunks
                    and
                    fleshy snouts of their kin.</strong> The tongue, used to chew, is often partially fused to the lower
                jaw; the muscles of the jaw are well-developed for the purpose of chewing food and bulge outward at the
                cheeks, lending the skull a somewhat triangular profile.</p>
            <p>Though more primitive than the ornitheres and trunksnouts and other fleshy-snouted vivas, the primitive
                serilopes are still diverse and abundant by the Thermocene. <strong>The majority of groups are
                    medium-sized
                    deer-like generalists of forest habitats</strong>, feeding mainly on fruit, seeds, and tender shoots
                but
                also opportunistically preying on insects and small animals. Some species retain the large feathered
                wings
                of their ancestors, but the majority of surviving species have highly reduced arms. To make up for this,
                they have developed exceptionally long tails for purposes of maintaining balance, tipped in a fan of
                vaned
                plumage, <strong>often the last tuft of proper feathers retained on a body otherwise covered in a
                    fur-like
                    coat of short, unbranched fibers.</strong> The combination of a short beak, lipped mouth, triangular
                skull profile, elongated tail and primitive-looking plumage <strong>lend many of these species not only
                    a
                    comparable place in the ecosystem but also an appearance very reminiscent of the extinct ornithopod
                    dinosaurs</strong> of ancient Earth. More broadly, they hark back to appearance of the earliest
                dinosaurs which would eventually give rise to all the clade's wide diversity, <strong>almost as if after
                    several hundred million years, the birds have finally gotten over their rebellious flying phase and
                    returned to their roots.</strong> Unlike any other dinosaur of the past or present, however,
                <strong>these "neo-dinosaurs" give birth to live young</strong> - just one, as a mother can hold only a
                single egg at a time in her oviduct as it incubates. Because they produce relatively few offspring, all
                of
                the serilopes are excellent mothers and protect their young ones until they are fully able to fend for
                themselves. In this respect, at least they are more akin to deer or other ungulates than to non-avian
                dinosaurs. The method used to process food is of course distinct too - ornithopods using their teeth and
                vivas having had to circumvent the loss of their teeth by redeveloping analogous structures on their
                tongues
                - but the end result is the same. Because of the many superficial similarities, many of the serilopes
                which
                no longer quite look like proper birds but haven't developed fleshy cheeks or snouts are known as
                <strong>"pseudornithopods"</strong>, though <strong>the term is a paraphyletic classification</strong>
                as it
                is used to refer to animals of several groups of only distant relations, whose closest relatives may not
                all
                fall under the same catch-all label. </p>
