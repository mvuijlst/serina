        <h1>Cleaner Ants</h1>
        <p> <strong>Cleaner ants</strong>, as their name would hopefully suggest, are a number of species of Serinan
            ants, not always closely related to one another, which have adapted to feed partially or entirely on the
            dead tissue and ectoparasites of larger animals, mainly birds. Their evolutionary origins surely come from
            the behavior of many birds known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anting_%28bird_activity%29"
                rel="nofollow">anting</a>. Whereas anting in its primitive form involves the use of ants merely as tools
            for the bird in question and usually results in the harming or killing of many ants by the end of the
            process, the symbiosis adopted by cleaner ants and their patrons is a mutually beneficial affair. Depending
            on the species, cleaner ants may construct their nests on the ground or in tree hollows, but in both
            instances are usually easily discovered if you know what to look for, for they are almost always surrounded
            by groups of small birds queuing up for their turn to be looked over by the workers. To avoid being eaten,
            as well as to immediately identify their intent, <strong>they are colored brightly</strong> in unmistakable
            patterns of black, red, and yellow; their markings are not bluff, either, <strong>for they carry potent
                stings</strong> and will utilize them readily if the colony feels threatened. To demonstrate their
            willingness to be cleaned, and lack of ill intent, <strong>a bird thus also must provide a special signal
                before the ants will let down their guard</strong>; it will lean over to one side, point its bill
            skyward - showing that is has no interest in a meal - and raise a wing high over its head, allowing the
            insects to crawl up into its plumage. The ants then crawl through its feathers, searching for blood-sucking
            mites, dead skin cells and anything else edible that they can grab in their jaws and take back to the
            colony, while their partner waits patiently as the ants cleanse its troubles away, eventually turning to the
            other side to allow its cleaners to reach every part of it body. When the process is complete, the bird's
            skin will be exfoliated, any small wounds will be cleaned and disinfected of septic tissue, and most of its
            blood-sucking parasites will have been removed. As an added bonus, the waiting birds are also sure to leave
            plenty of droppings near the colony, which the generalistic ants will also pick through for additional
            edible pieces, such as seeds that may have passed through the birds' stomachs intact. <strong>A detente has
                thus been formed between the two natural enemies, each of which could harm its partner, but has far more
                to gain by getting along. </strong> </p>
        <p>Some cleaner ants have interestingly lost their ability to fly entirely, with small vestigial wings even as
            sexually fertile adults. <strong>Instead, they rely on birds to disperse and form new colonies.</strong>
            Grabbing a hold onto a feather or the scales of its leg, newly-emerged fertile queens and drones stay with
            the bird for as long as a week before dropping off, sometimes many miles from their nest site. Knowing
            instinctively that wherever they have dropped off is likely a favorable spot for birds to rest and has a
            high chance of being visited by more birds again in the future, they will form a new colony right nearby to
            start the cycle anew.</p>
        <p class="asterism">&#8258;</p>
        <p>Cleaning behavior has evolved multiple times in ants upon Serina. Another group, only very distantly related
            to the colonial cleaner, specializes entirely in much larger animals. These ants are no longer social and
            belong to the group of flying, wasp-like predators known as <strong>vespers</strong>. Like the cleaner
            finches, they follow herds of large herbivores and feed mainly upon the large blood-sucking
            <strong>tickmites</strong> that plague them, without harming the birds themselves; while docile if
            unprovoked, except towards the small parasites upon which they feed, they do retain a painful sting as a
            defense against smaller flying birds. <strong>They exhibit a novel method of rearing their
                offspring</strong> which is also shared by some other flying ants; <strong>they carry their single larva
                in their middle pair of legs and raise it right there</strong>, rather than at a nest site, feeding it
            portions of every mite it subdues - the avian blood contained within is particularly nutritious for the
            developing young. To make up for their small brood size, young grow quickly and females are long enough
            lived to be able to rear a new larvae every three weeks for as long as two years. </p>
