        <h1>The Bumblets: Quadrupedal Burrowers</h1>
        <p><strong>Bumblets</strong> are the smallest of the vivas (ovovivavian aardgeese), most species weighing only a
            few ounces, <strong>and since their appearance over one hundred million years ago, they have become some of
                the most specialized of all birds.</strong> They are now highly adapted to burrowing underground. Though
            their common ancestor was only a part-time burrower and fed predominately above ground, the single surviving
            family of the late Thermocene is completely subterranean. Unlike the beak-driven molebirds, <strong>they dig
                their tunnels with paddle-like wings, the underlying skeletal structure of which are almost totally
                vestigial except for the very large wrists</strong>, which attach almost directly to the shoulder
            girdle; the upper and lower arm bones are extremely reduced in size and almost immobile. The wrist, however,
            has a wide range of circular movement and functions as a shovel; a large claw on the thumb loosens soil
            while the rest of the hand pushes it backwards and to the sides. The short tail of the bumblet's ancestors
            has been totally lost again and to make up for the space needed in its abdomen to carry its eggs, the body
            of the bumblet has elongated. The feet are very small and are now positioned at the extreme end of the body,
            able to help push it along in its burrows, but not to walk or really to stand at all. The larger wings now
            do most of the work in locomotion and are used by the bumblet to crawl through its burrows. Projected
            outwards to its sides, <strong>the bumblet is capable of walking quadrupedally</strong> by putting weight on
            the interior side of its wrists, which then move alternately forward and back, with the approximate gait,
            speed, and grace (or lack thereof) of a baby sea turtle as it dashes out to sea.</p>

            <figcaption> <strong>above:</strong> the sacrificial bumblet. This species is typical in size and form of
                most of its family; it grows to about seven inches in length and weighs about four ounces. Females are
                marginally larger than males.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p><strong>Unlike molebirds, bumblets are carnivorous</strong>, and despite their cute and pudgy appearance are
            fierce predators for their size. Though a bumblet's beak is small and usually thin, it is armed with tiny
            keratin teeth on both jaws which help to secure a grip on prey, usually insects and earthworms, but
            occasionally other vertebrates and even other birds. Once food has been captured, it is cut apart by slicing
            motions of the the tongue which is also lined with teeth as in other vivas. The food is swallowed in large
            chunks and then further broken down in the stomach. <strong>Bumblet metabolisms are fast and they must spend
                most of the day feeding</strong>, even in winter, for they cannot hibernate.</p>
        <p><strong>Bumblets have independently evolved true viviparity from the serilopes</strong>, through different
            means. Whereas the highly muscular oviduct of serilopes toughened so that the hard eggshell fragments from
            hatched eggs could simply be voided without causing injury after the chick was born, like afterbirth, the
            bumblets are the first birds to evolve away from hard-shelled eggs entirely. <strong>The calcium content in
                their eggshells are low, an adaptation that leaves their eggs soft and pliable;</strong> this allows
            these smallest of vivas to carry multiple eggs at a time without the risk of them bumping together and
            breaking in the mother's body. This increases the female's potential fertility, allowing her to raise broods
            of as many as five chicks at a time compared to the single offspring of almost every other viva, which can
            be very beneficial, for compared to larger animals her average lifespan as a small prey animal is often much
            shorter. It comes with considerable costs, however; to still fit in her body cavity - made even smaller by
            her lack of a tail - her eggs are proportionally much smaller than those of other vivas relative to her body
            weight, <strong>and her chicks hatch out in a much more dependent and vulnerable state.</strong> Indeed,
            they are not only blind, featherless, and completely dependent on her for food and warmth for the first few
            weeks of their lives, <strong>but they hatch out even with under-developed skeletons composed almost totally
                of cartilage</strong>; without calcium in the eggshell, bone development is delayed until after
            hatching, when the mother begins to feed her chicks a rich secretion of crop milk high in the minerals
            necessary for their growth. Shortly before giving birth, a mother bumblet must thus create a suitably safe
            and secure nest underground where her young will spend the first few weeks of their lives. </p>
        <p>Another issue with life underground is a lack of oxygen. The adult bumblet itself manages to get by with
            proportionally large lungs and a highly efficient system of air sacs. The developing eggs in its oviduct,
            however, are at a high risk of suffocation in this stagnant environment. <strong>Most vivas living above
                ground rely on rhythmic pumping of their abdominal walls in order to produce negative pressure, sucking
                air into the cloaca and oxygenating the oviduct similarly to lung</strong>, but oxygen concentrations in
            the burrows inhabited by the bumblet are often extremely low. <strong>To keep its eggs oxygenated, bumblets
                have had to adopt a new strategy which would not work for larger animals;</strong> their oviducts are
            completely closed off to the cloaca by a valve and instead the tissue of the oviduct itself is extremely
            oxygenated. Gases absorbed through the mother's respiratory system are diffused directly from her blood into
            the chamber where her eggs are incubated, and waste gases - mainly carbon dioxide - <strong>are expelled
                occasionally as a puff of flatulence from her backside.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>For most of the year bumblets don't normally come to the surface unless their tunnels are
                flooded</strong>, in which case they may be seen scurrying for higher ground in large numbers.
            <strong>They must do so in order to find a mate</strong>, however, and these few nights a year are likely
            the only reason that the bumblet retains an acceptable sense of vision, for it certainly doesn't have much
            function underground. Females sit at the openings to their tunnels while males leave theirs to find them.
            Both genders emit ultrasonic chirps, forming a duet which becomes faster as the partners come closer until
            the calls join into a single hum. There is no courtship and it seems females are not very particular,
            usually accepting any male that comes to their doorstep, allowing the gauntlet of predators that capitalize
            on the emergence of the males from their tunnels to do all the thinning necessary of the weakest genes in
            the pool. After mating, the female returns underground and the male continues on his trek to find another
            partner. In most bumblets, he'll try his luck until sunup and then return to the burrow to feed and restore
            his energy reserves. For the male of the <strong>sacrificial bumblet</strong>, however, this is not enough.
            Even if he mates several females, he is instinctively driven to continue, putting himself at risk more and
            more the longer he stays above ground. The harsh reality is, however, that no matter what he does once he
            leaves his burrow, his fate is sealed. Even the fastest and sliest males, which manage to avoid predators,
            will not return home. <strong>Spending as long as three days on a sexual binge and foregoing all feeding,
                even the most fortunate will eventually die of exhaustion.</strong></p>
        <p>Only the female sacrificial bumblet ever makes it into her second year of life; males almost invariably die
            after mating, either from predators or starvation. By providing the ultimate sacrifice - which provides
            their common name - <strong>by removing themselves from their burrows and territory, their mates and
                developing offspring will have more resources for themselves.</strong></p>
